  description: |
    Alternate form is an ability possessed by lycanthropes (werewolves, werebears, wererats), druids, vampires, and other creatures capable of assuming <emphasis>specific</emphasis> forms.
  effect: |
    You gain the ability to shapeshift into a single form (you choose that form when purchasing this feat and it cannot be changed). Assuming your new form is a major action. When you assume your new form, you gain a pool of points equal to your Alteration score, which you may immediately spend to temporarily increase your physical attributes. You cannot raise any physical attribute to be greater than your Alteration score, unless the physical attribute is already equal to your Alteration. In that case, you may increase it by a maximum of one point. This increase cannot be used to meet prerequisites for feats, but it can be used to give you access to banes and boons that you would otherwise not be able to use in your normal form. Until you purchase this feat at tier 3, you cannot use the supernatural attributes of the chosen form.

    You return to your normal form immediately if you are reduced to zero hit points. You can also choose to voluntarily return to your usual form as a major action. Upon returning to your original form, your physical attributes return to their previous values.
    <ul>
    <li>Tier 1 – Your alternate form must be the same size as your normal form.</li>
    <li>Tier 2 – Your alternate form can be one size different from your normal size.</li>
    <li>Tier 3 – Your alternate form can be any size. In addition, you are able to use supernatural attributes for attacks (dragon’s breath, nymph’s charm, etc.) of your chosen form. Use your Alteration score for action rolls relating to these supernatural abilities.</li>

  cost:

  description: |
    Your prowess in a supernatural, mental, or social attribute empowers a physical aspect of your character, allowing you to use that attribute for tasks normally reserved for another attribute.  Examples of Attribute Substitution in play include a martial artist who is physically weak but capable of using internal chi to throw and disable opponents, as well as an anatomical genius who uses their intelligence to make vital strikes rather than their dexterity.
  effect: |
    When you purchase this feat, you create a permanent link between two attributes: one stronger (the primary attribute) and one weaker (the dependent attribute). When making action rolls with the dependent attribute, you may use your score in the primary attribute for damaging attacks, bane attacks, boon invocations, and other actions at the GM's discretion. This relationship is subject to case-by-case approval by the GM. It must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include an analytical warrior or martial artist who analyzes angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a gunslinger who channels dark energy, giving her deadshot accuracy and substituting Entropy for Agility.
    For the purpose of meeting attribute prerequisites when purchasing feats, your dependent attribute is considered equal to that of your primary attribute score.
    <strong>Special</strong>: This feat can only be purchased once. In addition, the primary attribute must be either social, mental, or supernatural, while the substituted attribute must be physical.

In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the aptitude to work supernatural powers for yourself or create a desired effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably replicate a single boon.
  effect: |
    When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the Power Level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your attribute score as the Power Level of the boon. Additionally, you count as having access to the chosen boon for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for meeting such prerequisites is equal to the Power Level of the boon. The Boon Access feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based on character level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of their feat points to begin play with access to a Power Level 6 boon.
    You may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon.
    <strong>Special</strong>: If you ever meet the attribute prerequisite for the chosen boon, you may choose at that time to lose this feat and regain the feat points spent. Re-allocate them as you choose.

    <li>Tier 2 - When your invocation includes multiple targets, you gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon. Additionally, invoking the boon is one time increment faster.  If the invocation time is a major action, it becomes a minor action.  If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 major action.  If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute.  If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes.  If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour.</li>

  description: |
    You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, brewing potions, or building extraordinary devices. Their power is permanent but varies depending on your skill.
  effect: |
    This feat allows you to create items that can invoke a given bane or boon either autonomously or by way of a wielder.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - You can create an item with this feat. Choose a target attribute score for the item, less than or equal to 2 points below the attribute you use in the creation process (e.g. if you have an attribute score of 5, the maximum score of the item is 3). <br />
      Next, choose whether the item is permanent or expendable. A potion or scroll may be an expendable item that triggers the heal boon, for example, while a ring of invisibility may be a permanent item that triggers the invisibility boon when the wielder concentrates on using it.  <br />
      Creating an expendable item requires 1 full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Creating a permanent item, requires one such day of work per attribute score of the item. <br />
      At the end of this period, make an attribute roll with a prerequisite attribute. The CR of this roll equals 10 plus twice the attribute score of the item.
      <br />
      Next, choose a bane or boon of power level less than or equal to the item's attribute score from the previous step. This item is forever linked to that particular bane or boon.
      <br />
      An expendable item used to invoke a boon automatically succeeds at invocation. An expendable item used to invoke a bane grants advantage 1 to the attribute roll to invoke.<br />
      A permanent item can be invoked once per hour, after which it has to recharge before it can be used again. <br />
      The banes and boons available for imbuing depend on the attribute used to create the item, as follows:
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Any Supernatural Attribute</strong> - The item can only be imbued with a bane or boon that is accessible to the creator via the attribute used. </li>
      <li><strong>Learning</strong> - You can imbue an item with only Physical attributes (Might, Agility, Fortitude) and the corresponding banes and boons.</li>
      <li><strong>Creation</strong> - Being capable of manifesting something from nothing via channeling otherworldly energy, you can imbue the item with any attribute, even if you do not have a score in that attribute.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Following the same rules above, you gain the following additional benefits: <br />
      <ul>
      <li>The target attribute score for the item can now be equal to your attribute score or less. So, with a prerequisite attribute score of 5, you can imbue an item with an attribute score of 5.</li>
      <li>For expendable items, bane attacks have advantage 2 instead of advantage 1.</li>
      <li>You can imbue low-level sentience or autonomy into your crafted items. During creation, you work with the GM to define a set of conditions that cause the item to trigger. Some examples include magically guided fireballs triggered when someone enters a given area or a teleportation circle that activates when someone steps on a magical trigger. For those imbuing with non-magical means, this autonomy could be more mundane, for example: pressure plates surrounded by murder holes (arrow slits with self-reloading crossbows).</li>
      <li>Permanent items you imbue not only possess the imbued attribute score for the purpose of invoking a particular bane or boon, but can make attacks with their attribute score. If the item's attribute is greater than the wielder's, then it supersedes the attribute for the wielder. For example - a Flaming Sword imbued in the 9th circle of Hell could have Energy 9, allowing a town guard with Might 3 to make attacks with Energy 9 instead of Might 3.  A non-supernatural example could be ballistae on a large battlement that are imbued with Agility 4 and can be used to invoke the Forced Move bane.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You can imbue human-like sentience into the item, it gains its own personality and intelligence. This epic feat should be worked out closely with your GM to specify a blueprint for what the item's personality, mission, preferences, and similar values will be, and the GM should elaborate and add unforeseen quirks or flaws that make sense given the item's purpose.</li>

    Whether your are delivering flurry of blows, wielding two weapons, or calling a chain of lightning bolts from the sky, you have mastered the art of delivering multiple attacks.
  effect: |
    Before attacking, you may declare that you are multi-attacking, and must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. ALL of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 6; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 9). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1.

    You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging attacks, but you may not invoke boons. Resolve each attack individually, applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same creature more than once. There is no limit to the number of additional attacks you can make using this feat.

    <strong>EXAMPLE</strong>
    Vax the Deathbringer has Multi Attack Specialist (Tier VI). He declares that he will be making three attacks this round. Therefore, all of his attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 3 = 9, minus 6 for feat tier 6). His first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10'-square. Because of the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his total disadvantage for that attack 5. For his second attack, Vax casts a spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of disadvantage 6.

    By channeling your supernatural powers through extensive rituals, such as meditation, fasting, blood letting, and sacrifices, you are able to increase the strength of your invocations.
  effect: |
    When invoking a bane or boon, you may choose to do so as a ritual. The invocation time for a ritual is one increment higher than usual as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>1 action becomes 1 minute</li>
    <li>1 minute becomes 10 minutes</li>
    <li>10 minutes becomes 1 hour</li>
    <li>1 hour becomes 8 hours</li>
    <li>8 hours becomes 24 hours</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Tier 1</strong> - You may choose one of the following effects to empower your bane or boon:<br />
    <ul>
    <li>Increase the range of the effect as follows:
      Attribute 5 = 500ft<br />
      Attribute 6 = 1/2 mile<br />
      Attribute 7 = 1 mile<br />
      Attribute 8 = 10 miles<br />
      Attribute 9 = 100 miles<br /></li>
    <li>Negate two levels of disadvantage caused by multi-targeting (e.g., Target 2 creatures or a 10' square for free instead of disadvantage 2).</li>
    <li>For your action roll, treat your attribute score as if it was one greater for purposes of determining attribute dice. Note that this doesn’t grant access to banes or boons you could not normally access. It only increases the dice used for the action roll.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain the following abilities:
    <ul>
      <li>You can lead others to join you in ritual casting as long as they are also able to invoke the bane or boon at the same power level that your are invoking it at. At the conclusion of the ritual, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.</li>
      <li>You gain the following additional option to choose from when empowering your invocations with ritual magic:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without need to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot disrupt the boon through use of a focus action (Though the dispel bane still works).</li>
        <li>Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute after it is invokes.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <strong>Tier 3</strong> - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the ritual process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or dispelled. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the ritual and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active ritual invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the ritual was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll as follows:

    <li><strong>Bestow Boon</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual Magic feat (see the Remove Boon entry that follows).</li>
    <li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual Magic feat (see the Remove Bane entry that follows).</li>
    <li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the bane automatically.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - Make an Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though the bane can still be invoked by other means.</li>
