  description: |
    Alternate form is an ability possessed by lyncanthropes (werewolves, werebears, wererats), druids, vampires, and other creatures capable of assuming <emphasis>specific</emphasis> forms.
  effect: |
    You gain the ability to shapeshift into a single form (you choose that form when purchasing this feat and it cannot be changed). Assuming your new form is a normal action. When you assume your new form, you gain a pool of points equal to your Alteration score, which you may immediately spend to temporarily increase your physical attributes. You cannot raise any physical attribute to be greater than your Alteration score, unless the physical attribute is already equal to your Alteration. In that case, you may increase it by a maximum of one point. This increase cannot be used to meet prerequisites for feats, but it can be used to give you access to banes and boons that you would otherwise not be able to use in your normal form. Until you purchase this feat at tier 3, you cannot use the supernatural abilities of the chosen form.

    You return to your normal form immediately if you are reduced to zero hit points. You can also choose to voluntarily return to your usual form as a normal action. Upon returning to your original form, your physical attributes return to their previous values.
    <ul>
    <li>Tier 1 – Your alternate form must be the same size as your normal form.</li>
    <li>Tier 2 – Your alternate form can be one size different from your normal size.</li>
    <li>Tier 3 – Your alternate form can be any size. In addition, you are able to use supernatural attacks and abilities (dragon’s breath, nymph’s charm, etc.) of your chosen form. Use your Alteration score for action rolls relating to these supernatural abilities.</li>

  cost:

  description: |
    Your prowess in a supernatural, mental, or social attribute empowers a physical aspect of your character, allowing you to use that attribute for tasks normally reserved for another attribute.  Examples of Attribute Substitution in play include a martial artist who is physically weak but capable of using internal chi to throw and disable opponents, as well as an anatomical genius who uses their intelligence to make vital strikes rather than their dexterity.
  effect: |
    When you purchase this feat, you create a permanent link between two attributes: one stronger (the primary attribute) and one weaker (the dependent attribute). When making action rolls with the dependent attribute, you may use your score in the primary attribute for damaging attacks, bane attacks, boon invocations, and other actions at the GM's discretion. This relationship is subject to case-by-case approval by the GM. It must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include an analytical warrior or martial artist who analyzes angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a Holy Warrior that draws on divine power in place of physical power to substitute Presence for Might.
    For the purpose of meeting attribute prerequisites when purchasing feats, your dependent attribute is considered equal to that of your primary attribute score.
    <strong>Special</strong>: This feat can only be purchased once and only at 1st level. In addition, the primary attribute must be either social, mental, or supernatural, while the substituted attribute must be physical.

In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the aptitude to work supernatural powers for yourself or create a desired effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably replicate a single boon.
  effect: |
    When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the Power Level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your attribute score as the Power Level of the boon. Additonally, you count as having access to the chosen boon for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for meeting such prerequisites is equal to the Power Level of the boon. The Boon Access feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based on character level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of their feat points to begin play with access to a Power Level 6 boon.
    You may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon.

  description: |
    You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, potions, or building extraoridnary devices, traps, etc. Their power is permanent but varies depending on your skill.
  effect: |
    This feat allows you to create items that can invoke a given bane or boon either autonomously or by a wielder.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - You can create an item with this feat. Choose a target attribute score for the item, equal or less than 2 points below the attribute you use in the creation process (e.g. if you have an attribute score of 5, the maximum score of the item is 3). <br />
      Next, choose whether the item is permanent or expendable. A potion or scroll may be an expendable item that triggers the Heal boon, while a ring of invisibility may be a permanent item that triggers the invisibility boon when the wielder concetrates on using it.  <br />
      Creating an expendable item requires 1 full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Creating a permanent item, requires one such day of work per attribute point. <br />
      At the end of this period, make an attribute roll with a prerequisite attribute. If you fail the roll, typically nothing bad happens, but you must begin the cycle again and spend the same amount of time to try again at creating the item. The created item has an attibute score less than or equal to the CR of your roll, no greater than two points less than the attribute you used in the roll to create. So, on a 16 you can create an item with an Attribute score 3 or less, if you have a score of 5 or greater for the prerequisite attribute used in item creation.
      <br />
      Next, choose a bane or boon of power level less than or equal to the item's attribute score from the previous step. This item is forever linked to that particular bane or boon.
      <br />
      An expendable item used to invoke a boon automatically succeeds at invocation. An expendable item used to invoke a bane gets Advantage 1 to it's attribute roll.<br />
      A permanent item can be invoked once per hour, after which it has to recharge before it can be used again. <br />
      The banes and boons available for imbuing depend on the attribute used to create the item, as follows:
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Any Supernatural Attribute</strong> - The item can only be imbued with a bane or boon that is accessible via the attribute used. </li>
      <li><strong>Learning</strong> - You can imbue an item with only Physical attributes (Might, Agility) and the corresponding banes and boons.</li>
      <li><strong>Creation</strong> - Being capable of manifesting something from nothing via channeling otherworldly energy, you can imbue the item with any attribute, even if you do not have a score in that attribute.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Following the same rules above, you gain the following additional benefits: <br />
      <ul>
      <li>The target attribute score for the item can now be equal to your attribute score or less. So, with a prerequisite attribute score of 5, you can imbue an item with an attribute score of 5.</li>
      <li>For expendable items, bane attacks have Advantage 2 instead of Advnatage 1.</li>
      <li>You can imbue low-level sentience or autonomy into your crafted items. During creation, you work with the GM to define a set of conditions that cause the item to trigger. Some examples include: magically guided fireballs triggered when someone enters a given area, or a teleportation circle that activates when someone steps on a magical trigger. For those imbuing with non-magical means, this "autonomy" could be more mundane, for example: pressure plates surrounded by murder holes (arrow slits with self-reloading crossbows).</li>
      <li>Permanent items you imbue not only possess the imbued attribute score for the purpose of invoking a particular bane or boon, but can make attacks with their attribute score. If the item's attribute is greater than the wielders, then it supersedes the attribute for the wielder. For example - a Flaming Sword imbued in the 9th circle of Hell could have Energy 9, allowing a town guard with Might 3 to make attacks with Energy 9 instead of Might 3.  A non-supernatural example could be ballistae on a large embattlement that are imbued with Agility 4 and can be used to invoke the Forced Move bane.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You can imbue humanlike sentience into the item, it gains it's own personality, intelligence, this epic feat should be worked out closely with your GM, you should specify a blueprint for what the item's personality, mission, preferences, etc. will be, and the GM should elaborate and add unforeseen quirks or flaws that make sense given the item's purpose.</li>

    You have trained with one weapon to the extent that your martial prowess is handicapped when you use any other weapon.  An example of a character with Martial Focus would be a Kensei (Sword Saint) devoted to mastery of their Katana.
  effect: |
    Martial focus reflects a character’s training in a particular weapon (or unarmed combat) which sets a course for their entire skill progression. Characters with this ability focus their prowess on a single weapon (or unarmed combat style). Discuss your story concept with your GM before choosing your supernatural focus. When using your martial focus, your selected Agility or Might attribute score is increased by 1 when wielding your Martial Focus chosen weapon, though your actual attribute score is unchanged. For all purposes outside of dice rolled, your ability score is unchanged (prerequisitess for feats, banes, boons, etc.).  The trade-off for this power is dependence, since this focus is an inherent part of the way the character trains and grows in martial prowess, for any other martial attack you make without your martial focus, you suffer Disadvantage 1 on the attack.<br />
    Special: This ability can only be taken at character creation because it reflects a career-long dedication that begins prior to the start of a campaign. In extraneous circumstances, a GM may allow a character to purchase this after some life-altering event.

    You develop a signature attack that combines two different banes into a single attack.
  effect: |
    Choose two banes that you are able to inflict. You are able to make attacks that inflict your targets with both banes at once.  Your attribute score must be equal to or greater than the power level of both banes combined.  If the two banes use different key attributes, provided your key attributes for both banes is sufficient, you use the higher of the two attributes for both the attack and determining if you are powerful enough to combine them.  An example would be the ability to summon up a powerful arctic blast that inflicts both the slowed bane and also the blinded bane.  Slowed is PL 2 and Blinded is PL 4, so purchasing this power to combine the two would require a character to have a attribute score of 6 or higher in either the key attribute for slowed or the key attribute for blinded.  The resulting “new” bane acts as a single bane and has the combined effects of both banes and can be inflicted in the same various ways that another bane can be inflicted.<br />
    <strong>Special</strong>: If you have bane focus for one of the two selected banes but not the other, you can only trigger this combined bane with a bane attack or 10 an attack that deals 10 or more damage. You can trigger with 5 damage or more if you have bane focus in both banes.

    You are able to channel your supernatural power to greater effect, given enough time - examples include ritual circles, long periods of time spent in research, prayer, fasting, and other methods that help to clear and focus the mind.
  effect: |
    You gain the ability to heighten the effect of banes or boons you invoke through lengthy ritual that increases their invocation time.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - You can voluntarily increase the invocation time of any bane or boon by 1 increment (1 action => 1 minute, 1 minute => 10 minutes, 10 minutes => 1 hr, 1 hr => 8hrs, 8hrs => 1 day) in order to increase the effect in one of the following ways:<br />
      <ul>
      <li>Increase the range of the effect as follows:
        Attribute 5 = 500ft<br />
        Attribute 6 = 1/2 mile<br />
        Attribute 7 = 1 mile<br />
        Attribute 8 = 10 miles<br />
        Attribute 9 = 100 miles<br /></li>
      <li>Increase the area of the effect by either 1 target or 1 square and ignore the multi-targeting penalty normally associated with that targeting increase</li>
      <li>You can increase your attribute dice (not score) by 1 for the action roll to invoke the bane or boon. Note that this doesn’t grant access to banes or boons you could not normally access, it only increases the dice used for the action roll.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    <strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain the following abilities:
    <li>
    <ul>
      <li>You can heighten a bane or boon invocation with multiple contributing characters with the same Supernatural attribute. Doing so sets a minimum invocation time of 1 hour, heightening the effects of banes or boons that normally have a lesser invocation time per the rules of Tier 1. All participants must already be capable of invoking the bane or boon. When heightening the effects of a bane or boon as outlined in Tier 1, each additional participant heightens the invocation in the same way that a time increment increase would as outlined in the Tier 1 feat description (range, area, or attribute dice).</li>
      <li>You can increase the invocation time by 1 increment to a minimum of 10 minutes, and cause the bane or boon to persist for 1 minute automatically. In the case of boons, a sustain action is not required, the boon persists automatically and can’t be interrupted by breaking the caster’s concentration (only via Dispelling with Abjuration). In the case of banes, after the initial action roll to invoke the bane, the first resist roll allowed is 1 minute after the bane is invoked (this applies to both voluntary resist rolls and free resist rolls that would normally be part of the bane’s effect)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the ritual process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or dispelled. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the ritual and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active ritual invocation you must be in the same physical / geographic location where the ritual was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll with a DL according to the boon or bane’s Power Level. Bestowing or Dispelling a bane or boon is detailed below:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Bestow Boon</strong> - You cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a Sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual feat (see the Remove Boon entry that follows).  The boon must be invoked using an attribute that could normally be used to invoke it.</li>
        <li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - You cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent  bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow Resist rolls to end it’s effects. The effect can be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual feat (see the Remove Bane entry that follows). The bane must be invoked using an attribute that could normally be used to invoke it. </li>
        <li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - You cause a permanent boon (as described in the previous entry) to be forever stripped from the target, causing it to lose the ability to invoke the bane automatically.  This dispelling can be done only with an Entropy action roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - You break the curse of a permanent bane (as described in the previous entry) afflicting the target, the bane can still be invoked by other means.  This dispelling can be done only with an Abjuration action roll.</li>

  description: |
    You have been trained in a method of channeling your supernatural power through a point of focus that increases your power.
  effect: |
    Supernatural focus reflects a character’s training in some supernatural attribute which can only be learned as a beginner. Characters with this ability are able to focus their power through one of the following foci: voice, wand, crystal ball, weapon, spellbook, staff, holy symbol, etc. (discuss your story concept with your GM before choosing your supernatural focus). When using your supernatural focus, your selected supernatural attribute score is increased by 1 when you wield your focus, though your actual attribute score is unchanged. For all purposes outside of dice rolled, your ability score is unchanged (feats, banes, boons, etc.).  The trade-off for this power is dependence, since this focus is an inherent part of the way the character invokes the chosen supernatural attribute, the character cannot make action or attack rolls with that power without their chosen focus.
    <strong>Special</strong>: This ability can only be taken at character creation because it affects how the character will use Supernatural effects depending on how they learned.

    Something about you reveals your inherent supernatural nature through a visible manifestation.

  effect: |
    At the discretion of the GM, your supernatural presence will have differing effects on different groups that you interact with – some will be cowed into fear or reverence, others will inherently trust or distrust you depending on the NPC’s beliefs about your power and it’s perceived source. The GM should allow you to occasionally use your supernatural presence to gain Advantage 1 to a Presence or Persuasion action roll. From time to time the GM should have that same bonus become a Disadvantage 1 instead, depending upon the beliefs and opinions of those you interact with.
