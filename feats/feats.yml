    You have the ability to transform from one persona to another, whether that be through bodily transformation like a werewolf or through exterior mechanisms, such as a cybernetically enhanced soldier who can call forth a symbiotic mech suit.
  effect: |
    Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Half of your primary form's attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3 feat points less than your primary form.</li>
    </ul>
    Whenever your primary form gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains points according to the above formulas.
    As a focus action, you may change between any two forms (including your primary form or any alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms.
    Each form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.
    In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30. During combat, Mr. Hyde suffers 10 damage. When he later transforms back into Dr. Jekyll, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from his new maximum, leaving the doctor with 5 out of 15 hit points. Additionally, when changing forms, if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total becomes 1 instead.
  special: |
    When selecting feats for your alternate form, you may not select the <em>Alternate Form</em> feat.
    With GM approval, you may take this feat multiple times. If you do, you get access to an additional form. Multiple Alternate Forms can be a powerful way of accumulating new feat points and attributes. The GM should prevent players from exploiting the feat to create an overly powerful character.

    You are adept at redirecting your enemy's attacks. Whether using fancy footwork, magical force, or tactical superiority, you know how to force your enemy to attack unintended targets.
  effect: |
    When you make a defend action and your roll exceeds the attacker's action roll, you can choose to redirect the attack to a target that is neither you, nor the attacker. The original attack roll does not change, only the target. If the attack was a melee attack, you can redirect it to anyone within 5' of you (as opposed to within 5' of the attacker).

    Like a samurai who masters the art of the katana or an elementalist who specializes in summoning flame, you are so well trained with a particular form of attack that you can devastate foes with much more skill than the average combatant.
  effect: |
    When you take this feat, select one weapon or attack type. You gain advantage 1 per tier of this feat for any <em>damaging</em> attack made with your chosen attack type. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or boon invocations.
    Examples of attack types you can choose to specialize in include fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, and force - though this list is not exhaustive.
  special: |
    In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new weapon or attack type each time. Your total advantage to an attack is equal to your tier for that particular weapon or attack type. For example, a character might have Attack Specialization II (Fire) for fire attacks and Attack Specialization IV (Longsword) for longsword attacks.

  cost:

  description: |
    Your prowess in an extraordinary, mental, or social attribute is linked in a way that empowers another attribute of your character, allowing you to use that attribute for tasks normally reserved for another. Examples of Attribute Substitution in play include a martial artist who is physically weak but capable of using internal chi to throw and disable opponents, an anatomical genius who uses logic to make vital strikes rather than their agility, or a gunslinger whose deadshot aim is the result of a dark pact.
  effect: |
    When you take this feat, you create a permanent link between two attributes: one stronger (the primary attribute) and one weaker (the dependent attribute). You may use your primary attribute in place of the dependent attribute for different purposes depending on which tier of the feat you have:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Making non-attack, non-defend, non-invocation action rolls</li>
      <li>Calculating hit points, defenses, and other secondary statistics</li>
      <li>Meeting feat prerequisites</li>
      <li>Other situations at the GM's discretion</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tier 2</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Making attack and defend action rolls</li>
      <li>Invoking banes and boons</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    The relationship formed by your two attributes is subject to case-by-case approval and must be approved by the GM first. The link must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. For example, a brawler who substitutes their Logic for their Might to represent their ability to use leverage in grappling rather than strength would likely not get to use their Logic score for an attempt to bend the bars on a prison cell. Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include a calculating warrior who studies angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a gunslinger who channels dark energy, giving her deadshot accuracy and substituting Entropy for Agility.

  effect: |
    Choose a bane that you can invoke. When your roll on a damaging attack exceeds the target's defense by 5 or more (as opposed to the usual 10), you can inflict this bane for free. Each attack is still only capable of inflicting a single bane. Furthermore, when making a bane attack to inflict your chosen bane, you gain advantage 2 on the bane attack roll.

If your total armor bonus is less than 3, it becomes 3. If you take three consecutive turns without making an attack roll against an enemy creature, the battle trance ends.

In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the aptitude to work extraordinary powers for yourself or create a desired effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably replicate a single boon.
  effect: |
    When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the power level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your attribute score as the power level of the boon. If the boon has multiple attribute prerequisite options, you choose one attribute when you take this feat. Additionally, you count as having access to the chosen boon for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for meeting such prerequisites is equal to the power level of the boon. The Boon Access feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based on character level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of their feat points to begin play with access to a power level 6 boon.
    You may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon.
  special: |
    You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a new boon to gain access to.
    Note that this feat can give access to high-powered boons with a potential for very dramatic impact on the storyline of a game. As such, using this feat to access a boon of power level 6 or higher should be approved by the GM before using it in a game.
    If you ever meet the attribute prerequisite for the chosen boon, you may choose at that time to lose this feat and regain the feat points spent. Re-allocate them as you choose.

  effect: |
    Choose a single boon that you can invoke. You gain benefits with that boon according to your tier in this feat.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action. Beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.</li>
    <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:
      <br />
      <strong>If the chosen boon has a duration of "sustain persists"</strong>, you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, one instance of the boon can be sustained each round as a free action, rather than a minor action. If the boon is somehow temporarily canceled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action. If targeted by the <em>nullify</em> bane, this effect can only be canceled by a power level 6 or greater invocation of that bane.
      <br />
      <strong>If the boon has a different duration</strong>, you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.
    </li>

In order to do so, you spend your own feat points and the companion receives the feat instead of you. The companion, not you, must meet all feat prerequisites.

    You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, building futuristic technology, brewing potions, or crafting extraordinary devices. Their power is permanent but varies depending on your skill.
  effect: |
    Provided you have the appropriate working space and materials (as determined by the GM), you can create extraordinary items (as detailed in Chapter 9: Special Equipment). You can only imbue an item with attributes, banes, and boons that you can access. For example, in order to create a sword with Energy 5, you must possess an Energy score of 5 or higher. The only exception to this is if you possess the Creation, Learning, or Logic attributes. These allow you to imbue items with any attribute, bane, or boon as long as their value is less than or equal to your attribute score. The GM may rule that certain uses of Creation, Learning, or Logic are unreasonable when it comes to crafting extraordinary items.
    Your tier in this feat determines the maximum wealth level of the items you can create, based on the attribute you are using to craft:
    <ul><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Maximum wealth level equals attribute minus 2</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Maximum wealth level equals attribute minus 1</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - Maximum wealth level equals attribute</li></ul>
    For example, a character with Creation 5 and tier 1 in this feat could create items up to wealth level 3.
    You can determine the wealth level of the item you want to create by consulting the sample items in <strong>Chapter 9: Special Equipment</strong> or by developing a custom item using the rules for <strong>Building Your Own Extraordinary Items</strong> in that chapter.
    Creating an item with the <em>consumable</em> or <em>expendable</em> property requires one full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Other items require a duration of uninterrupted work based on their wealth level, as follows:
    <ul><li><strong>Wealth Level 1 - 3</strong>: Two days per wealth level.</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 4 - 5</strong>: Four days per wealth level.</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 6 - 7</strong>: One week per wealth level.</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 8 - 9</strong>: One month per wealth level.</li></ul>
    At the end of this time, your item is created. Crafting an item still counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient wealth score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth provided in <strong>Chapter 5: Wealth & Equipment</strong>. The GM may waive some or all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a suit of Armor of Fire Resistance, the GM may decide that the dragon’s hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor’s wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.

  effect: |

You gain complete control over the target's senses (as granted by the power level of your bane), and thus the hallucination is not restricted by size or area. Your hallucination may only target a single creature and is not eligible for multi-targeting attacks. In addition, unless the target is damaged, they suffer disadvantage on resist rolls against the bane.</li>

    By channeling your extraordinary powers through extended research or extensive rituals, such as meditation, fasting, blood letting, or sacrifices, you are able to increase the strength of your invocations. This feat is common among wizards, inventors, mad scientists, and similar characters who use extraordinary abilities to achieve great deeds.
  effect: |
    When invoking a bane or boon, you may choose to do so as a heightened invocation. The invocation time for a heightened invocation is one increment higher than usual as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>1 action becomes 1 minute</li>
    <li>1 minute becomes 10 minutes</li>
    <li>10 minutes becomes 1 hour</li>
    <li>1 hour becomes 8 hours</li>
    <li>8 hours becomes 24 hours</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Tier 1</strong> - When performing a heightened invocation, you may choose one of the following effects to empower your bane or boon:<br />
    <ul>
    <li>Increase the range of the effect as follows:
      Attribute 5 = 500ft<br />
      Attribute 6 = 1/2 mile<br />
      Attribute 7 = 1 mile<br />
      Attribute 8 = 10 miles<br />
      Attribute 9 = 100 miles<br /></li>
    <li>Negate two levels of disadvantage caused by multi-targeting (e.g., target 2 creatures or a 10' square for free instead of disadvantage 2).</li>
    <li>For your action roll, treat your attribute score as if it was one greater for purposes of determining attribute dice. Note that this doesn't grant access to banes or boons you could not normally access. It only increases the dice used for the action roll.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain the following options when you perform a heightened invocation:
    <ul>
      <li>You can lead others to join you in group invocation as long as they are also able to invoke the bane or boon at the same power level that you are invoking it at. At the conclusion of the group invocation, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.</li>
      <li>You gain the following additional options to choose from when empowering your invocations with heightened invocation:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without needing to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot end the boon through use of a disrupting attack (though the <em>nullify</em> bane still works).</li>
        <li>Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute after it is invoked.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <strong>Tier 3</strong> - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the invocation process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the invocation and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active heightened invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the invocation was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Bestow Boon</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will with a free action, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily with the <em>nullify</em> bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).</li>
    <li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be canceled either temporarily with the <em>nullify</em> bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that follows).</li>
    <li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the boon automatically.</li>
    <li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - Make a Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though your target gains no special immunity to it.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    Permanently bestowing banes or boons via this feat can dramatically impact the mechanical balance of a story. Just as with other permanent effects like Extraordinary Item creation, the invocation of permanent banes or boons is subject to GM's discretion, and using this feat in a way that makes one particular character overly powerful should be prohibited.

    When you use the <em>shapeshift</em> boon, you may take on the features of a specific creature. For example, instead of merely transforming into an elf, you can assume the guise of Galdion the elven king. The disguise is near perfect for those examining you visually. If your behavior or other signs provide reasonable suspicion, an onlooker can attempt a Perception roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + triple your Alteration or Deception score, whichever is higher. If they succeed, they will recognize your disguise.

    Whether you are delivering a flurry of blows, wielding two weapons, or calling a chain of lightning bolts from the sky, you have mastered the art of delivering multiple attacks.
  effect: |
    At the start of your turn, you may declare that you are multi-attacking. You must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. You receive a corresponding number of additional major actions, which can only be used for attacks. <em>All</em> of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of <strong>additional</strong> attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 3; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 6). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1.
    You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging attacks, but you may not invoke boons. Resolve each attack individually, applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same creature more than once.
    The number of additional attacks you can make with this feat is limited to 1 + half your level, rounded up. Thus, the limit is 2 additional attacks at 1st level, 3 additional attacks at 3rd level, and 6 additional attacks at 9th level.
    <strong>Example</strong> - Vax the Deathbringer has Multi-Attack Specialist (Tier III). He declares that he will be making three attacks this round (two additional attacks). Therefore, all of his attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 2 = 6, minus 3 for feat tier 3). His first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10'-cube. Because of the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his total disadvantage for that attack 5. For his second attack, Vax casts a spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of disadvantage 6.

A blast of ice that blinds and slows your enemy, a thunderous shotgun blast that hurls foes back and knocks them to the ground, and a wormtongue song that puts targets to sleep and alters their memory are all examples of a signature attack that could be created with this feat.
  effect: |
    Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining <em>knockdown</em> and <em>slowed</em>, both power level 1, would require an attribute score of 2). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately.
  special: |
    In order to benefit from the bane focus feat when using a multi-bane attack, you must possess bane focus for both banes.
    You may take this feat more than once. If you do, you must choose a different pair of banes for the new instance of the feat.

You may even declare your intent to enter a battle trance after the action has been resolved (such as after the attack has already been rolled).

    Your heightened awareness on the battlefield means that you are nearly impossible to catch flat-footed and are always prepared to defend yourself or allies. This feat is typified by such character concepts as the bodyguard, the abjurer, and the psychic defender.
  effect: |
    Once per round, after you have expended your next major action to perform a defend action, you get an additional major action that must be spent before the start of your next turn to make another defend action. Multiple tiers of this feat grant additional major actions usable only for defend actions.

    You are expertly focused on dealing with a particular species, race, or faction. Perhaps your family was slain by werewolves, and you have devoted your life to studying their mannerisms in order to hunt them down. Or maybe you were raised in a prison on the third moon of Vogax Prime, and you know the Vogans better than they know themselves.
  effect: |
    Choose a species, race, or faction (e.g., dragons, Void Templars, gnolls, or vampires). You learn the primary conversational language of that species, and at the GM's discretion, you may have some level of access to other special forms of communication (such as thieves' cant or secret hand signals). Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 per tier of this feat to all Mental attribute rolls (Learning, Logic, Perception, and Will) pertaining to your chosen group.
  special: |
    In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new group each time. Your total advantage on Mental attribute rolls is equal to your tier for that particular group. For example, a character might have Sworn Enemy II (Void Templars) and Sworn Enemy IV (Werewolves).

    Being both physically powerful and incredibly agile, you are able to wield a weapon in one-hand that requires two hands for others. Good examples of this feat in action include an orcish barbarian wielding a great axe and shield and a survivor in the zombie apocalypse wielding two chainsaws.
  effect: |
    You can wield weapons with the two-handed property in one hand and you gain the benefits of both the two-handed and one-handed property while doing so. This means that you gain a total of advantage 2 when wielding a two-handed weapon in each hand, advantage 1 from the power of a two-handed weapon plus advantage 1 from having one weapon in each hand.

    Whether you are an enchanter, psychic, or mad scientist, you have mastered the art of enthralling others. Your charms are so potent that your victims may fall permanently under your compulsion.

    When you invoke the <em>charmed</em> bane, targets who do not make their resist roll within 24 hours of being afflicted become permanently affected by the bane. They do not receive any more resist rolls to shake themselves free of the effect. Other extraordinary effects like a <em>nullify</em> bane can still end the effect (and other methods may work at the GM's discretion).
