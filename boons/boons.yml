    You are able to supernaturally absorb an object into your body through such means as the mutation or alteration of your body (moving muscles and ligaments aside to make room for it) or by creating an extradimensional space to hide it.
  effect: |
    The object remains in place, completely hidden from the perception of others, until you summon or recall it (automatically) as a minor action. If anything happens to cancel this boon (such as the Dispel bane), the object is immediately shunted out of your body as if you had withdrawn it to your hand.

    You create life or unlife of subhuman intelligence that persists indefinitely and autonomously.
  effect: |
    Your are able to imbue life or unlife into inanimate material components such as dirt, bones, water, vines, or sand (the materials used are subject to GM discretion).  You perform a ritual that last 8 hours. At the end of the ritual, make your action roll. If successful, the inanimate form is imbued with sentience. If you used the Creation attribute to invoke this boon, then it is a normal living creature.  If you used Entropy, then the creature is undead. You can use this boon to animate existing creatures or undead, such as by creating a live wolf from bones and fur or a zombie from an unearthed tomb. However, you cannot use this boon to animate supernatural creatures, such as dragons or basilisks.  Your ability to animate the creature grants no special control or influence over it. Since it was birthed through magic, it has no concept of family, creator, or parent. In the case of aggressive creatures, the GM would handle interaction normally, but there is a strong possibility that the creature would immediately attack its creator.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can animate a single creature. Your attribute score must be equal to or greater than the highest attribute score of the creature you’re animating.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - You can animate a group of creatures:  Either 10 creatures with a max attribute of 2, or 5 creatures with a max attribute of 3, or 2 creatures with a max attribute of 5.</li>

    Choose a space or object within range. Darkness emanates from the target to a radius equal five feet per power level of the boon. The effect cancels the effect of all natural light within its radius of effect and creatures that depend on light for vision suffer as though they have the blinded bane while in the area of effect. Creatures that do not depend on light for their vision (if they have tremorsense, blindsight, etc) are unaffected. If the darkness area overlaps an area affected by the Light boon, then the one of greater power level supersedes the other.  If the power level of both is equal, then they cancel each other out.

    You gain supernatural vision that allows you to see colored auras which correlate to magical and spiritual forces.
  effect: |
    When calling on this boon, you must choose from the following: <strong>holy</strong>, <strong>unholy</strong>, <strong>life</strong>, <strong>death</strong>, and <strong>magic</strong>.  You can perceive invisible auras pertaining to the chosen type of force and have an approximate sense of their strength (from weak to overwhelming).  These auras are usually based on an action that is deliberate, so an otherwise kind shopkeeper would radiate an aura of death for a time after poisoning or killing someone.  Even a Paladin slaying an evil archmage will give off a radius of death for a time after the killing blow.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Holy</strong> - Holy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the heavens or similar good-aligned dimensions where pure goodness is embodied. </li>
    <li><strong>Unholy</strong> - Unholy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the hells or similar evil-aligned dimensions where pure evil is embodied.</li>
    <li><strong>Life</strong> - Beings from heavenly dimensions, clerics wielding the power of healing, resurrection, or protection radiate an aura of life for a time after wielding such powers.</li>
    <li><strong>Death</strong> - Necromancers, undead, and murderers all radiate an aura of death.  For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death and magic is what animates them.</li>
    <li><strong>Magic</strong> - Magical auras surround objects or places imbued with magical effects. Supernatural creatures who are innately magical, such as a nymph, constantly radiate magic. Natural creatures who wield magic, such as a human wizard, give off an aura only following use of their power.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Special</strong>: Unlike other boons, this boon can not target another character. Only the character invoking the boon can see the auras.

    A target's physical structure is temporarily altered, allowing it to change form to potentially any creature no matter how fantastic or exotic. Common examples of shapeshifting include lyncanthropes (such as werewolves), dryads, dopplegangers, and certain types of druids.
  effect: |
    You or a willing creature you touch transform into a creature whose highest attribute is less than or equal to your Alteration score.  All of the target's existing supernatural attribute scores drop to zero, and they acquire the Agility, Fortitude, Might, and Perception attributes of the new form.  The following limitations apply at Power Level 2, and are gradually removed at higher power levels:
    <ul>
    <li>The new form cannot be a different size than that of the target.</li>
    <li>The new form must possess a typical humanoid or animal physiology. Animal-like creatures, such as dragons, are allowed, but plants, elementals, oozes, and similar forms are not.
    <li>The target does not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming, climbing, burrowing, etc.).</li>
    <li>The target does not gain supernatural attributes of the new form (hence, they cannot inflict banes that rely on the creature’s supernatural attributes).</li>
    </ul>
    These limitations are removed based on the Power Level of the boon.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between half and double the target's original size. Gain any non-flight movement modes of the new form.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between one quarter and quadruple the target's original size. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Gain the flying movement mode of the new form, if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - Shapeshift into a living creature that lacks a typical physiology, such as an elemental, ooze, or a plant.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature of any size. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Gain all supernatural attributes possessed by the target. </li></ul>
    <strong>Special</strong>: Shapeshifting into a specific creature (attempting to impersonate them) requires a Deception action roll which is opposed by Perception attribute of anyone who sees the shapeshifted creature. In addition, at power levels 4 and lower, the target does not gain mastery over any special movement modes granted by the new form. As such, the movement speed is cut in half for movement modes not native to the original form, and the GM may rule that certain actions, such as swimming in combat, suffer disadvantage on relevant action rolls.

If you choose to, for each minute of invocation (delay before making your action roll) you can teleport 1 mile, up to a maximum number of miles equal to your Movement attribute score. While the distance is greater, this mode is also dangerous, as a misunderstanding of direction or geography can put you many miles in an unfavorable direction. You simply choose a direction to travel in (relative to your starting location) and you teleoport a number of miles equal to your Movement score. During invocation, you must spend a Focus action each turn until the invocation time passes.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Using the same longer invocation time from Power Level 7, you can now teleport to any location without range limit, provided you have personally seen (through magical or normal means) the target destination.</li>
