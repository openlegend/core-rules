    You are able to absorb an object into your body through such means as the mutation or alteration of your body (moving muscles and ligaments aside to make room for it) or by creating an extradimensional space to hide it.
  effect: |
    The object remains in place, completely hidden from the perception of others, until you summon or recall it (automatically) as a minor action. If anything happens to cancel this boon (such as the Dispel bane), the object is immediately shunted out of your body as if you had withdrawn it to your hand.

  effect: |
    Your are able to imbue life or unlife into inanimate material components such as dirt, bones, water, vines, or sand (the materials used are subject to GM discretion).  You perform a ritual that last 8 hours. At the end of the ritual, make your action roll. If successful, the inanimate form is imbued with sentience. If you used the Creation attribute to invoke this boon, then it is a normal living creature.  If you used Entropy, then the creature is undead. You can use this boon to animate existing creatures or undead, such as by creating a live wolf from bones and fur or a zombie from an unearthed tomb. However, you cannot use this boon to animate supernatural creatures, such as dragons or basilisks.  Your ability to animate the creature grants no special control or influence over it. Since it was birthed through magic, it has no concept of family, creator, or parent. In the case of aggressive creatures, the GM would handle interaction normally, but there is a strong possibility that the creature would immediately attack its creator.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can animate a single creature. Your attribute score must be equal to or greater than the highest attribute score of the creature you’re animating.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - You can animate a group of creatures:  Either 10 creatures with a max attribute of 2, or 5 creatures with a max attribute of 3, or 2 creatures with a max attribute of 5.</li>

    You surround a willing target in an aura that hurts their foes or helps their allies. A shield of flame that burns attackers, a circle of healing, and an aura of elemental protection are all examples of this boon in action.
  effect: |
    An aura extends from a willing target to a distance determined by the Power Level of this boon:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4:</strong> 5' radius</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6:</strong> 10' radius</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8:</strong> 15' radius</li>
    </ul>
    Choose a single bane or boon which uses the same attribute that you used to invoke Aura. The maximum power level for the chosen bane or boon is one-half the power level of your aura. Your aura radiates the chosen bane or boon as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>If the aura radiates a bane,</strong> then the target of the aura is not affected by it. All other creatures (friend or foe) who willingly enter the area of the aura or end their turn within it suffer a bane attack to inflict the chosen bane. No creature may be subject to a bane attack from the same creature's aura more than once per round.</li>
    <li><strong>If the aura radiates a boon,</strong> then the target of the aura is also affected by it. The target and all allies who end their turn within the area of the aura automatically gain the chosen boon. Upon leaving the area of the aura, the boon is immediately removed. No creature may gain a boon from the same creature's aura more than once per round.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    This boon may require special attention and adjudication from the GM, as not all banes and boons may be an appropriate fit for an aura. Telekinesis, for example, is not a boon that can be granted to allies and thus does not work well as an aura.

    You summon forth a wall of thorns, ring of fire, entropic fog, or similar barrier to hurt or hinder your foes.
  effect: |
    When you invoke this boon, you must use multi-targeting to create a specific area of effect to define the space of your barrier. Upon successful invocation, choose a number of available properties for your wall based on your power level:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3 - </strong>Choose 1 property: Damaging (1d4), Obscuring, Hindering</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5 - </strong>Choose 2 properties: Damaging (1d8), Obscuring, Hindering, Baneful, Mobile</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7 - </strong>Choose 3 properties: Damaging (1d10), Obscuring, Hindering, Baneful, Mobile, Impassable</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9 - </strong>Choose 4 properties: Damaging (2d6), Obscuring, Hindering, Baneful, Mobile, Impassable</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Damaging:</strong> A creature who ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, automatically suffers the indicated damage. A creature may only suffer this damage once per round.
    <br>
    <strong>Obscuring:</strong> Creatures cannot see through more than 10' of the barrier.
    <br>
    <strong>Hindering:</strong> Creatures move at half speed when travelling within the barrier.
    <br>
    <strong>Impassable:</strong> Creatures and objects cannot move through the barrier.
    <br>
    <strong>Baneful:</strong> Choose a bane which you can inflict that has a Power Level less than or equal to the Power Level of your Barrier. When a creature ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, you may immediately make a bane attack against it to inflict the chosen bane. A creature can only be subject to one such bane attack from this barrier per round.
    <br>
    <strong>Mobile:</strong> You may spend a standard action to move the barrier up to 30 feet.

The effect cancels the effect of all natural light within its radius of effect and creatures that depend on light for vision suffer as though they have the blinded bane while in the area of effect. Creatures that do not depend on light for their vision (if they have tremorsense, blindsight, etc) are unaffected. If the darkness area overlaps an area affected by the Light boon, then the one of greater power level supersedes the other.  If the power level of both is equal, then they cancel each other out.

    You gain extraordinary vision that allows you to see colored auras which correlate to magical and spiritual forces.
  effect: |
    When calling on this boon, you must choose from the following: <strong>holy</strong>, <strong>unholy</strong>, <strong>life</strong>, <strong>death</strong>, and <strong>magic</strong>.  You can perceive invisible auras pertaining to the chosen type of force and have an approximate sense of their strength (from weak to overwhelming).  These auras are usually based on an action that is deliberate, so an otherwise kind shopkeeper would radiate an aura of death for a time after poisoning or killing someone.  Even a Paladin slaying an evil archmage will give off a radius of death for a time after the killing blow.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Holy</strong> - Holy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the heavens or similar good-aligned dimensions where pure goodness is embodied. </li>
    <li><strong>Unholy</strong> - Unholy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the hells or similar evil-aligned dimensions where pure evil is embodied.</li>
    <li><strong>Life</strong> - Beings from heavenly dimensions, clerics wielding the power of healing, resurrection, or protection radiate an aura of life for a time after wielding such powers.</li>
    <li><strong>Death</strong> - Necromancers, undead, and murderers all radiate an aura of death.  For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death and magic is what animates them.</li>
    <li><strong>Magic</strong> - Magical auras surround objects or places imbued with magical effects. Extraordinary creatures who are innately magical, such as a nymph, constantly radiate magic. Natural creatures who wield magic, such as a human wizard, give off an aura only following use of their power.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    Unlike other boons, this boon can not target another character. Only the character invoking the boon can see the auras.

  description: |
    A target's physical structure is temporarily altered, allowing it to change form to potentially any creature no matter how fantastic or exotic. Common examples of shapeshifting include lyncanthropes (such as werewolves), dryads, dopplegangers, and certain types of druids.
  effect: |
    You or a willing creature you touch transform into a creature whose highest attribute is less than or equal to your Alteration score. Your Alteration score for the purpose of this feat is limited to your level or 5, whichever is higher. All of the target's existing extraordinary attribute scores drop to zero, and they acquire the Agility, Fortitude, Might, and Perception attributes of the new form.  The following limitations apply at Power Level 2, and are gradually removed at higher power levels:
    <ul>
    <li>The new form cannot be a different size than that of the target.</li>
    <li>The new form must possess a typical humanoid or animal physiology. Animal-like creatures, such as dragons, are allowed, but plants, elementals, oozes, and similar forms are not.
    <li>The target does not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming, climbing, burrowing, etc.).</li>
    <li>The target does not gain extraordinary attributes of the new form (hence, they cannot inflict banes that rely on the creature's extraordinary attributes).</li>
    </ul>
    These limitations are removed based on the Power Level of the boon.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between half and double the target's original size. Gain any non-flight movement modes of the new form.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between one quarter and quadruple the target's original size. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Gain the flying movement mode of the new form, if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Shapeshift into a living creature that lacks a typical physiology, such as an elemental, ooze, or a plant.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature of any size. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Gain all extraordinary attributes possessed by the target.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    Shapeshifting into a specific creature (attempting to impersonate them) requires a Deception action roll which is opposed by Perception attribute of anyone who sees the shapeshifted creature. In addition, at power levels 4 and lower, the target does not gain mastery over any special movement modes granted by the new form. As such, the movement speed is cut in half for movement modes not native to the original form, and the GM may rule that certain actions, such as swimming in combat, suffer disadvantage on relevant action rolls.

    You reach out and extraordinarily control an unattended inanimate object.
  effect: |
    Immediately upon invoking the boon, and again each round when you sustain the boon, you may move the target object up to 30'. As part of moving an object, you may also manipulate it (for example, turning a door knob or opening a coin purse). A new invocation of this boon must be attempted whenever you wish to target a different object. The Power Level of the boon determines the size and weight of the objects you may target:
    <ul><li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - The object must be smaller or lighter than a fist-sized rock.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - The object must be smaller or lighter than a large humanoid creature.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - The object must be smaller or lighter than a small building, such as a hut or shed.</li>

    You reach out mentally to a willing target and speak wordlessly with thought-to-thought communication.
  effect: |
    You and the target can communicate with each other simply through thought. Note that this telepathy does not bestow intelligence upon creatures, so you could not use it to communicate with a squirrel unless you already possessed other means of doing so. Additionally, telepathy does not bypass language barriers, so you would need to already speak the language of your target.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can communicate telepathically with a single creature of animal-level intelligence or lower. Keep in mind that it can only communicate concepts with you that it can understand.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - You can communicate telepathically with a single creature of humanoid intelligence.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can create a mental relay between yourself and up to five other creatures allowing each of them to communicate with the rest of the group simultaneously.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - You can communicate telepathically with any number of creatures that you can see.</li>

    You are able to instantly move from one place to another, either by stepping into an intermediate realm, projecting yourself magically, or other similar means.
  effect: |
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can teleport to any unoccupied space within 5 feet per Movement attribute score as long as you can naturally see it. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Your teleportation range is unchanged, but you can now teleport to spaces that you can’t see.  If you choose an occupied space, you land in the nearest adjacent space (roll randomly to decide if there are multiple options) and you are stunned for 1 round (you don’t have to make a resist roll to end the effect). </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - You can opt to take longer in invoking the boon. If you choose to, for each minute of invocation (delay before making your action roll) you can teleport 1 mile, up to a maximum number of miles equal to your Movement attribute score. While the distance is greater, this mode is also dangerous, as a misunderstanding of direction or geography can put you many miles in an unfavorable direction. You simply choose a direction to travel in (relative to your starting location) and you teleoport a number of miles equal to your Movement score. During invocation, you must spend a Focus action each turn until the invocation time passes.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Using the same longer invocation time from Power Level 7, you can now teleport to any location without range limit, provided you have personally seen (through magical or normal means) the target destination.</li>

  effect: |
    Your Power Level determines the types of matter your can transmute as well as the duration of the effect. The duration is either <em>temporary</em> or <em>permanent</em>. A <strong>temporary</strong> transmutation must be sustained every round and has a maximum duration of 1 hour per your Alteration attribute score. A <strong>permanent</strong> transmutation does not have to be sustained and persists until some other effect would cancel it.

    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - <em>Temporarily</em> transmute an object into another object of the same size and weight.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - <em>Temporarily</em> transmute an object into another object of the same size and 50% greater or lesser weight. <em>Temporarily</em> transmute an object into another object of the same weight and 50% greater or lesser size.</li>

    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - <em>Permanently</em> transmute an object into another object of up to 200% difference in size or weight. <em>Temporarily</em> transmute a living creature into another creature of the same size.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - <em>Temporarily</em> transmute a living creature into a non-living object of the same size, or vice-versa. <em>Temporarily</em> transmute a living creature into another creature of ANY size.</li></ul>
