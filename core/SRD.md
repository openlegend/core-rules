# Character Creation


## Step 1: Describe Your Character

*Open Legend* is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear that we will learn about in later steps. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can't think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Your race.** Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that's a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.

As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your **size**: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10'x10' square in combat and has a 10' reach (see Chapter 6: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.

At the GM's discretion, you may choose to be even smaller or larger than the sizes described above. A large creature's reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15'x15' base would have a 15' reach. Small creatures always have at least a 5' reach.

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits.** Maybe you stutter when you're nervous. Maybe you don't trust anyone until they've proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won't find out about until they've gotten to know you quite well. It's also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign.

Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in *Open Legend* will be determined by the roll of dice.

To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character's attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.

Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll. If your total is equal to or greater than the action's Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.

\ \ \ \ \ \ progresses. *(GM's Choice)* |


## Step 2: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in *Open Legend*. They define what your character can and can't do--the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you'll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In *Open Legend*, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and extraordinary.

A character's skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero.

The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.

In *Open Legend*, you get to define your character's strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.


\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| Attribute Quick Builds |
| - |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 |


### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don't have to spend all of your points at character creation.


### Purchasing Attributes


\NextTableColumns{OCT{.50}OCT{.50}}

| Attribute Score | Cost |
| - | - |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |


### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You'll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

### Attribute Dice

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.50}OCT{.50}}

| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |



## Step 3: Record Defenses, Hit Points, and Speed

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with the shot of a rifle, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| - |
| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability. For example, foes attempting to poison you, drain your life force, or stun you will target your toughness.

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| - |
| Guard = 10 + Agility + Might + Armor |

**Guard** protects you from attacks that can either be dodged, deflected, or directly withstood via raw physical power. Your enemies would need to overcome your guard in order to hit you with a grenade, shoot you with an arrow, or smash you with a maul.

\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| - |
| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |


**Resolve** represents your character's ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.


\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| |
| - |
| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |


*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

**Speed** indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 6: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.

## Step 4: Purchase Feats

While your character's attributes define his skill at accomplishing
heroic tasks, his **feats** are what make him unique among other
characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him
the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so they take the *Combat Momentum* feat to allow them to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes [*Battle Trance*](#battle-trance) so that they can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate their foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat
points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

A list of available feats can be found in this SRD under the [feats section](#feats-list) and a searchable and filterable list of available banes and boons can be found on the [Open Legend Website](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats).


## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of *Open Legend*, your character will start with the gear they need for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.

## Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws
In addition to the descriptive details you have just created, you may also choose up to two perks and up to two flaws from the following lists.

Perks are characteristics that describe very specific skills, attitudes, backgrounds, or opportunities that tend to give your character the upper hand in certain situations. For example, maybe you are a noble and thus able to draw favors from powerful political figures, or perhaps you once served as mechanic on a starship and those technical skills still help you out in your adventuring life today.

Flaws are your Achilles' heel. They are weaknesses that your enemies can exploit or character deficits that always seem to hold you back at just the wrong moment. Maybe you are stubborn as a mule and won't accept a compromise under any circumstances. Perhaps your greed tends to get the best of you, and your love of coin will even trump your loyalty to your friends. Your flaws might even be physical in nature: you're blind, missing an arm, or suffer from a wounded knee that slows you down.


### Activating Perks

Perks provide very specific bonuses or effects in specific situations. Your perk description will explain exactly what your perk does and how often it can be activated. Some perks can be used whenever the situation merits while others are more limited. If the use of a perk relies on a situation being relevant to the sphere of influence of the perk, the GM has the final say as to whether the perk applies or not. For example, the *profession* perk provides advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls related to your chosen profession. If a character wants to use their *profession: hunter* perk to gain advantage on a roll to track an orc, the GM would decide whether or not the PC's experience tracking game was relevant enough to aid in the hunt for a humanoid.

### Activating Flaws

While perks provide specific benefits according to their descriptions, flaws are actively used by players to hinder the actions of their characters. You would do this for two primary reasons: first, to add depth and variety to your character and the story; and, second, to earn legend points, which can be used to enhance your chances of success on a future action (see [Actions & Attributes](#actions-&-attributes). In this way, flaws and legend points provide a sort of karmic balance to one another. Your sacrifice in one situation is rewarded in the future.

You may not gain a legend point from the same flaw more than once per game session. Furthermore, you are in complete control of how and when your own flaws affect you. For example, you might play a blind samurai (using the *disabled* flaw) who has such heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch that they're usually completely unaffected by their blindness. Only under extreme circumstances does the blindness hinder them.

To activate a flaw, you should intentionally make a disadvantageous choice based on your flaw that creates an interesting or tense moment in the plot. When you do so, let your GM know that you are activating your flaw and describe how it is hindering your efforts or influencing your decisions. If the GM approves that your flaw is creating a significant disadvantage and advancing the story, you receive one legend point. Sometimes, the GM may recognize that you are roleplaying a flaw without you having to overtly activate it. In such cases, the GM may award you with a legend point as well.

The type of hindrance caused by activating a flaw should be more than a simple reduced chance of success. Good examples of activating a flaw include putting yourself or an ally in danger, making a bad decision, wasting a resource, and missing out on an opportunity, among others. It's also important to note that a good use of a flaw makes something new and interesting happen in the story rather than ending the narrative. For example, instead of activating a flaw to miss an attack, you might target an ally. Or, rather than activating a flaw to fail to find a secret door, you might make so much noise in your search that you attract unwanted attention.

### Gaining Perks and Flaws

At character creation, you may select up to two perks and two flaws, and you do not have to select any. Throughout your adventures, the GM may assign you additional perks and flaws as the natural results of your deeds. For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the *profession: sailor* perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the *physical deformity* flaw to describe your scarred face.

You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM's approval as your character's personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the *cowardly* flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the *artisan* perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws.

### Designing Your Own Perks and Flaws

The lists provided here are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.

Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.

Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the *artisan* perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the *attractive* perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the *idol* perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.



### Perk List

#### Ageless

Whether you are an android constructed of spaceage material that does not erode over time, the loyal servant of a higher power, or the subject of an arcane ritual, you have unlocked the secret to immortality. You are immune to the passage of time and the effects of old age. Your body does not age and you cannot be harmed by extraordinary effects that cause aging. Based on the source of your agelessness, you can decide whether or not your appearance changes over time.

#### Arcane Bloodline

Your ancestry can be traced to dragons, fey, or a similarly magical race. As such, you command the respect of those who practice the arcane arts. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the ways of magic, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you an apprenticeship with a famous Archmage, or cause a magic-user who does not know you well to follow a prescribed course of action based on your advice if the question is one of Arcane knowledge.

#### Artisan

Choose a specific craft, such as weapon smithing, glass blowing, or brewing. You know the ins and outs of crafting goods of the highest quality within your chosen specialty. As a master craftsman, you are able to create items of exceptional value given the necessary time and materials. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your crafting skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.

#### Ascetic

You are well-versed in the art of living with less. Whether a cloistered monk or a wizened sage who spent years locked away in a tower of books, you are experienced at going long stretches of time with very little food, water, or company - and as such, these situations tend not to affect you as they do others. You are hardened against physical and mental deprivation and have developed an enviable degree of self-mastery.

#### Attractive

You are just really darn good looking. This plays to your favor more than just romantically, and your good looks tend to help you out in all sorts of social situations. Whenever your attractiveness would play a role in a situation, you gain advantage 1 to any relevant action rolls.

#### Brute

While others might convince with a silver tongue, you speak the universal language of fear. Once per game session, if you make a show of physical force, you can use your *Might* attribute for a *Persuasion* roll. If your *Persuasion* score is already equal to or greater than your *Might* score, you get advantage 1 on the roll.

#### Courageous

Your heart is brave beyond bounds. Once per game session, as a free action you can cancel all negative effects upon you related to fear or low morale.

#### Crowd Favorite

Whether you are an actor, musician, storyteller, magician, or some other type of performer, the common folk love your work. They adore you for your ability to use your art to transport them to a world beyond their daily drudgery, and you can always find a place to perform and make money at the local tavern or inn.

#### Disease Immunity

You are immune to natural disease. This protection does not guard against magical curses such as lycanthropy.

#### Divine Agent

You serve a higher being and have earned their protection. Once per game session, when you are subject to a *Finishing Blow* while your hit points are below 1, you automatically heal to a hit point total of 1.

#### Divine Insight

You possess a supernatural connection to a deity, demi-god, or other divine being which grants you otherworldly insight. Once per game session, you can choose a topic relevant to the story. The GM shares some information about that topic which might be useful. If you've just failed a *Learning* attribute roll and use this ability, the GM decides whether to give you information related to that roll or to give you knowledge that is completely unrelated.

#### Ear of the Emperor

You have done something in the past to earn the favor of someone in a high place: a senator, the general of an army, a merchant lord, etc. Perhaps you saved their life or spared them from significant monetary loss. Whatever you did, they owe you, and they are willing to help you with minor favors as long as the favors do not subject them to any risk or cost. Once during the campaign, you can call in a large favor that does put your contact in risk or cost them something significant. They will perform the favor, but you immediately lose this trait, as their debt has been repaid.

#### Extraordinary Presence

Your inherent extraordinary nature manifests itself in a tangible way of your choosing. For example, your eyes may glow, your skin might emanate an icy chill, or a trail of withering plants could follow you wherever you set foot. Depending on the nature of your extraordinary presence, it might make others more likely to fear, admire, or trust you--or otherwise alter their initial perceptions of you. Whenever your extraordinary presence is relevant in a social situation, you gain advantage 1 on any action rolls you make.

#### Idol

Your reputation for some outstanding virtue precedes you, and people tend to hold you in high esteem. Once per session, you can call upon your reputation to inspire trust from someone who is skeptical of you, your actions, or your allies.

#### Innocent

Whether from a distant fey ancestry or simply an air of naivety, you possess a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts. Once per game session, you can leverage your innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you've done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.

#### Jack of All Trades

You have a knack for picking up new skills. Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided its Challenge Rating is less than or equal to 14.

#### Local Hero

You are well-known and respected as a protector of the common folk in a small region. The commoners look up to you, and will offer you food, shelter, and other necessities. They will even take risks or assume minor costs to aid or protect you, so long as the risk is not death.

#### Lucky

Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck to shine upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling boulder, or a town guardsman decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.

#### Merchant

You know the art of economics as well as the best of businessmen. A master of supply and demand, you have a knack for knowing when to buy and when to sell. You cannot be swindled when it comes to bartering, and you always know whether or not you are getting a fair price. Furthermore, you have friends in merchant circles and guilds in your home city, and you can easily gain them in new locations.

#### Nature's Ally

Creatures of nature can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals give you a wide berth, Druids give you the benefit of a doubt by assuming that you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with the chief of a small local tribe by virtue of your reputation for defending nature.

#### Noble

Being of high birth, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by lesser nobles and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.

#### Observant

Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing. If you use this ability after failing a *Perception* roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.

#### Outlaw

You are part of a criminal network, whether it be a thieves' guild, band of smugglers, or otherwise. Once per game session, you can call in a favor from a contact within your network to perform a mundane task such as gathering information or arranging safe passage. If the favor puts your contact at risk, they will still perform it but may ask for an equally risky favor from you in return.

#### Profession

Choose a specific trade, such as sailor, soldier, or miner. You know everything there is to know about the business and are a master of the requisite skills. A sailor, for example, can tie a knot for all occasions, navigate by the stars, and man any station aboard a ship. A soldier is well-versed in a variety of arms, understands military tactics, and knows how to navigate the chain of command with ease. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your professional skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.

#### Pure-hearted

Any goodly-natured creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral. Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you've taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.

#### Resilient

Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a Fortitude action roll of Challenge Rating less than or equal to 10 + twice your Fortitude score.

#### Scavenger

You have lived a life of need, and thus know how to make do when others would go without. Once per game session, you can easily acquire a single mundane item even though it would otherwise take time to get or be completely unattainable. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may decide that your acquisition is only temporary or subject to reasonable conditions. For example, you might use this perk to acquire a rope in the middle of a desert, but the GM may rule that it is so sun-baked and ancient that it will likely snap after a few uses.

#### Scent

Your sense of smell is similar to that of a wild beast. As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60'. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60'. Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 on attempts to track a creature if it has left a scent trail.

#### Scholar

You have spent years studying a particular discipline, such as science, herbalism, dragon lore, history, politics, or religion. Once per session, you can re-roll a failed *Learning* check related to your discipline, gaining advantage 2 on the re-roll. Furthermore, you have colleagues and connections within your discipline, and know the proper channels for gaining access to specialty laboratories, libraries, temples, or other collections of lore related to your field of scholarship.

#### Silver Tongue

You have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM's choosing about the creature.

#### Stone Sense

While underground you may fail to find what you're looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered. Furthermore, you have advantage 1 on any action rolls in which a familiarity with underground environments would prove helpful, such as attempts to identify the risk of a cave in or to find a secret passage within a cavern.

#### Street Rat

You were raised on the streets or at least spent a good deal of time crawling about them. As such, you know how to navigate urban areas quickly, make yourself unseen, and find a bite to eat when you're down on your luck. As one of the invisible urchins that crawl the city, you are also quite adept at picking up rumors in taverns and crowded streets.

#### Vagabond

Having spent significant time fending for yourself in the wilderness, you excel at surviving and navigating in the wild. You always know the direction of true north and you can automatically find enough food to feed yourself plus a number of additional people equal to your Learning attribute score.

#### Warrior's Code

As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this ability to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior's code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.

#### Whisperer of the Wild

Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.



### Flaw List

#### Absent-minded

Your live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters. Whatever the source of your absent-mindedness, you are slow to notice important details and have a tendency to get distracted at exactly the worst possible moment.

#### Addiction

The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you've got an itch that you need to scratch, and you'll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix. You get to decide the nature and severity of your addiction.

#### Ambitious

You are willing to do anything to get ahead in life and often that means trampling upon other people on your way to the top. When presented with a situation requiring empathy for those beneath you, it's typical for you to ignore their need. In addition, you may sometimes overreach in your attempts to get ahead, making bold and risky choices that can put you and those close to you in danger.

#### Bloodlust

Battle isn't just a way of life, it is *the* way of life. There isn't a conflict you've encountered that wasn't best solved with steel, and your allies will have a hard time convincing you otherwise. You are prone to starting fights when they aren't necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered.


#### Brash

You are bold and daring to the point of recklessness. You have no time for plans, calculations, or strategic thinking. A lot of brass and a peck of luck are all you need. Kick in the door and let the details sort themselves out.

#### Bravado

You have a flair for the dramatic, and will often undertake bold or daring maneuvers simply for the thrill of it. For example, in combat you might swing from a chandelier even if it offers no tactical advantage.

#### Cosmetic Deformity

Something about you makes you less attractive, undesirable to behold, or even just downright abominable. You get to decide the nature and severity of your deformity. Examples include a scarred cheek, vacant white eyes, a burn-covered body, and a missing nose. Whatever form this flaw takes, it is merely cosmetic and thus will generally only affect you in social situations.

#### Compulsion

You have an irresistible urge to perform a behavior of your choice. Examples include, grinding your teeth, tapping your foot, biting your fingernails, counting coinage, and washing your hands. Your compulsion can sometimes put you in awkward or embarrassing situations, such as needing to wash your hands immediately after shaking hands with an ambassador.

#### Cowardly

You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harms way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot.

#### Dimwitted

You aren't the sharpest tack in the box. It's not just that you weren't gifted with skill in academia, it's that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall. With the exception of your areas of expertise, you have a hard time learning new skills, following instructions, and maybe even remembering names.

#### Disabled

You have some physical deficiency that holds you back in life. You decide the nature and severity of your disability. Some examples of disabilities include blindness, deafness, missing limbs, partial paralysis, bone deficiencies, or allergies.

#### Greedy

You can't help it: you just like things. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you'll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You're easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.

#### Honest

You won't tell a lie or engage in deceitful speech, even to save your own life or the life of another.

#### Hot Tempered
Your fuse is short and your explosions are destructive. Sometimes your anger boils slowly over time and other times it erupts completely unexpectedly. But when you do fly off the handle, things rarely go well for you.

#### Illiterate

You can't read or write, even in languages that you speak fluently.

#### Literal Minded

You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is “raining cats and dogs”. If a friend exaggerated by saying “I'd kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice”, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend's life if Melzak did get elected.

#### Mood Disorder

You suffer from a psychological condition that directly affects your mood, such as depression or anxiety. You get to to determine the nature and severity of your mood disorder.

#### Naive

Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you're a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.

#### Overt

You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.

#### Overweight

You are carrying a few extra pounds, and they tend to get in the way at all the wrong times, such as when climbing a ladder or crossing a decrepit rope bridge.

#### Pacifist

You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism. You might just revert to violence as a last resort, or you may be so averse to combat that you won't lift a weapon even in defense of yourself or others.

#### Phobia

You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence, a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.

#### Proud

Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you're not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Star Force leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.

#### Psychotic

You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality. You get to determine the extent and nature of your psychosis, including any potential triggers. For example, you might believe that beings from another dimension are trying to abduct you, or perhaps you relive a nightmarish scene from your past whenever you are in the midst of a gun fight.

#### Short-winded

You have poor lung capacity and easily tire. Sprints, long runs, and forced marches are either impossible for you or they tend to leave you completely incapacitated afterwards.

#### Sick

You suffer from some sort of chronic illness or condition, such as tuberculosis, cancer, arthritis, or irritable bowel syndrome. Even if you possess the means to treat your disease or control the symptoms, you might still have episodes or flare ups that hinder your adventuring life.

#### Socially Awkward

Something about your behavior tends to rub people the wrong way. Perhaps you don't respect the personal space of others, you tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details. Whatever the nature of your awkwardness, it makes social situations difficult for you at times.

#### Stubborn
It's your way or the highway. Maybe not all of the time, but once you've made your mind up on an important matter, you won't budge. You probably won't even compromise.

#### Uncoordinated

Your body just doesn't work well with itself. You have trouble balancing, catching, throwing, and performing similar physical tasks that require dexterity or nimbleness.

#### Vengeful

You let no slight go unpunished. While some might be able to shake off an insult from a tavern drunk, you take it as a personal assault that demands satisfaction. The more severe the crime, the greater the vengeance you will mete out.

#### Zealous

You stand for a cause - whether it is a religion, a nation, a code, a way of life, or otherwise - and you will push the boundaries of normal behavior to uphold your cause. This might mean that you make yourself a social outcast by attempting to convert others to your cause, or it could mean that you are willing to perform an act you might otherwise consider evil, such as putting innocent lives in danger, if doing so would promote your cause.


## Gaining XP and Leveling Up

As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character's power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.

Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters, NPCs, and monsters. Until you reach 5th level, the maximum attribute score is 5. From levels 6 to 9, the maximum is equal to your level.

\newpage

#### Player Character Level Advancement

\ \

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.33}OLT{.34}}

| Total XP | Level | Maximum Attribute Score |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 5 |
| 9 | 4 | 5 |
| 12 | 5 | 5 |

| 18 | 7 | 7 |
| 21 | 8 | 8 |
| 24 | 9 | 9 |
| 27 | 10 | 9 |

### Feat and Attribute Points

For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points *every* time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.

Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.

The complete list of available feats can be found on the [Open Legend Website](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats).


#### Attribute Overview

\ \

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.33}OLT{.34}}

| Attribute Score | Cost | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |

| 3 | 6 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 10 | 1d10 |

| 7 | 28 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 36 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 45 | 3d10 |
| 10 | - | 4d8 |

**Note:** An attribute score of 10 cannot be purchased with attribute points. It can only be obtained through feats, boons, or other special means. No attribute may advance beyond a score of 10.

### New Hit Points

In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you'll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.



# Actions & Attributes

The Introduction and Chapter 1 provided you with the core mechanic for action resolution as well as a brief overview of what the different attributes are used for. This chapter will delve a little bit deeper, explaining when to make different types of action rolls and how to
interpret the results.

## When to Roll the Dice

*Open Legend* is about creating great stories full of epic moments of heroism, and you roll dice to determine the outcome of those moments. In short, you only need to make action rolls when the outcome of the intended action plays a significant role in the story. In combat, for
example, you'll be making plenty of action rolls to clash blades, sling spells, shoot blasters, and leap over treacherous chasms. But you don't need to roll a Persuasion check every time you go to buy something from the bazaar, and you don't need to roll Logic to remember where you left your multi-pass.

*Open Legend* includes a number of Extraordinary attributes that can be used to represent futuristic theoretical science, magic, or inherent supernatural capabilities. For all other types of attribute, you can make an action roll with an attribute score of zero, but Extraordinary attributes require a minimum score of 1 in order to attempt a roll.

## Every Roll Matters

Another important point in *Open Legend* is that every action roll should drive the story in a new direction, for better or worse. A failed roll should not let the story stagnate, nor should a failure be easily negated by a successful roll from another character.

If you look back to the Core Mechanic, you can see that a simple failure is not an option:


\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| THE ACTION ROLL |
| :-: |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.40}OCT{.60}}

| **If the action roll...** | **then the result is...** |
| :- | :--: |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  - *OR* - \
\ \ \ the player fails, but the story \
\ \ \ \ \ \ progresses. *(GM's Choice)* |


### Keep It Simple: Every Roll Matters for the GM

The “every roll matters” rule was designed to make player actions meaningful to the story whether they succeed or fail. It recognizes the fact that static pass/fail checks aren't particularly fun for players. But “every roll matters” also adds an extra layer of complexity to the game because it requires the GM to make on-the-fly interpretations.

**So when the GM makes a roll**, a success is a success and a failure is a failure.

This is for the sake of simplicity and fun. When a player fails a roll, it's not very fun if something doesn't come out of it. When the GM fails a roll, though, there is usually much rejoicing at the table.

### Group Action Rolls

Sometimes, the success of an action relies on the skills of multiple characters, such as a party of treasure hunters attempting to sneak past a pair of guards or two hackers working together to access restricted data. In these cases, all characters who are contributing to the task describe what they are doing and make an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Count the number of successes and failures based on the Challenge Rating of the task. If there are more failures then successes, the task fails. Otherwise, the task succeeds. The GM interprets this success or failure as if it were a single action roll, rather than interpreting each action roll separately.

The GM always has the final say as to when a group action roll is called for and, if so, which characters may contribute to the task.

## Determining Challenge Rating

Many actions that you will undertake in *Open Legend* have a Challenge Rating (CR) that is determined by the rules. Attacks in combat, for example, use one of the target's defense scores as the CR.

Oftentimes, though, the GM will need to determine the CR for actions that aren't spelled out clearly in the rules. In these cases, the GM can use the Challenge Ratings by Difficulty Table to set an appropriate CR.


\NextTableColumns{OLT{.25}OCT{.25}OLT{.50}}

\FloatingTable[t]

| Difficulty | Challenge Rating | Example Actions |
| :-: | :-: | :------ |
| Everyday | 10 | leap a 5' gap, climb a surface with ledges, break down a household door, haggle a simple merchant for a discount |
| Challenging | 15 | climb a rough surface, catch the drift of a text in an unfamiliar language, break down a strong wooden door |
| Heroic | 20 | climb a smooth surface, leap a 15' gap, translate a text in an unfamiliar language, convince a neutral party to take a risk for you |
| Epic | 25 | translate a text in an alien language, break down an iron door |
| Legendary | 30 | leap a 25' chasm, climb a flat surface, befriend an enemy with a vendetta against you |

It's important to note that Challenge Ratings are not typically set to be relative to the party's level. So, breaking down a strong wooden door is CR 15 whether the party is first level or tenth.

### Contested Actions

Sometimes, two or more characters are directly opposing each other in a test of strength, wits, or charm. For example, a mighty barbarian wrestles with a minotaur to get hold of a magical gem. Or three representatives of different star systems attempt to persuade the warleader of the intergalactic reavers to join their forces. Or a stealthy ninja attempts to sneak unseen past the watch of the monks on guard. These sorts of situations are called **contested actions**.

To resolve such contests, each character involved makes an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Whoever rolls the highest succeeds at the action. Sometimes, all parties use the same attribute for their action rolls, but often, each character will use a different attribute, as in the case of the rogue attempting to sneak (Agility) past the guard's watch (Perception).

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes, you will attempt an action under circumstances that give you a significant upper hand, such as when attacking an enemy from behind. Other times, you'll be working against exceptional hindrances, such as when trying to climb a rope that an enemy has covered in grease. In these types of cases, instead of adjusting the Challenge Rating of the task, the GM should assign your roll either **advantage** or **disadvantage**.

Advantage and disadvantage are always expressed with a numeric level, such as “advantage 1” or “disadvantage 3”. Multiple instances of advantage and disadvantage can add together, so if you have advantage 1 on an attack because you are flanking a foe, and you also possess a feat that grants you advantage 1, you have a total of advantage 2.

If a situation arises in which you are assigned both advantage and disadvantage, find the difference between the two values to determine your final outcome. For example, if you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 1, they negate each other and thus your action roll is normal. If you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 2, your action roll would be made with disadvantage 1.

### Effects of Advantage and Disadvantage

When you have advantage on an action, roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your advantage level. Then, when adding your dice together, ignore the lowest *X* attribute dice, in which *X* is your advantage level.

Disadvantage works in a similar manner. When you have disadvantage, you still roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your disadvantage value. However, instead of ignoring the lowest dice, you ignore the *highest* dice.

### Advantage and Disadvantage Are Only Applied BEFORE Explosions

Advantage and Disadvantage only apply to your initial pool of dice for an action roll. They do not apply to subsequent rolls granted by exploding dice.

### Advantage and Disadvantage Without Attribute Dice

When attempting any roll that does not include attribute dice, you roll 2 d20 and keep the higher die for advantage or the lower die for disadvantage, you cannot accrue advantage or disadvantage greater than 1. This applies to both actions performed with attribute score of zero, as well as non-action rolls (like the d20 used for a Resist roll). Your character is already so inept at the action that they cannot capitalize on cumulative circumstancial help or hindrances. In addition, if you make a roll without attribute dice, you cannot voluntarily incur disadvantage for some beneficial effect. Thus you cannot multi-target attack if you have an attribute score of zero.

### Assigning Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and disadvantage can be assigned by the GM due to situational effects, or they can be assigned by feats, banes, and boons. When assigned situationally, the GM should never apply more than one level of advantage or disadvantage. Feats, banes, and boons--on the other hand--will often provide multiple levels as they rise in tier or power level. The Advantage and Disadvantage Examples Tables provides a listing of typical situations in which the GM may assign advantage and disadvantage, though this list is by no means exhaustive.

| **Situations Meriting Advantage** | **Situations Meriting Disadvantage** |
| :- | :- |
| Attacking a surprised or unaware foe | Attacking while balancing on a beam |

| Attacking a flanked foe | Attacking while prone |

## Legend Points

An additional layer of depth to action resolution comes in the form of legend points, which allow players an opportunity to stack the dice when it comes time to perform a particularly legendary action.

Characters begin play with zero legend points, and the maximum they may acquire is 10. The GM may reward a PC with a legend point when they use one of their flaws to their own disadvantage or for particularly strong roleplaying (see Chapter 1: Character Creation).

The GM may also feel free to establish other rules for awarding legend points. For example, some GMs like to allow each player to award another PC one legend point each session. Other tables might have a vote for MVP or best roleplayer at the end of each session, with the winner gaining a legend point.

### Spending Legend Points

Before making an action roll, a PC may spend a maximum number of legend points equal to their level plus one. For each legend point spent, they gain advantage 1 on the action roll.


# Feats #

In this chapter, you'll find complete descriptions of all of the feats available to customize your character in Open Legend. Feats are used to define your character's specializations, the actions, tasks, and abilities they excel at beyond all others. Some feats will enhance your major actions, such as by allowing you to multi-attack with reduced disadvantage, while others will grant you completely new powers, such as the ability to change your shape.

## Acquiring Feats

During your adventurers, the GM will award you Experience Points (or XP) for accomplishing quests and driving the story forward. Every time you gain XP, you also gain 1 feat point that can be used to purchase new feats just as you did during character creation. You do not have to spend these feat points when you gain them. You can feel free to save any unused feat points to be used at a later time.

## Reading a Feat Description

Each feat description includes the following elements.

**Title.** The name of the feat. Some feats contain multiple tiers, rising in power with each new tier. If a feat contains multiple tiers, these will be indicated in parentheses after the title (e.g., “Alternate Form (I - II)” ).

**Cost.** This is the number of feat points required to purchase the feat. If the feat has multiple tiers, the cost is the same for each tier and must be paid every time the feat is purchased at a new tier *unless otherwise noted in the feat description*.

**Prerequisites.** Many feats have specific requirements that must be met before a character can purchase the feat. Prerequisites may take the form of a minimum attribute score, another feat, or a special requirement. If a feat has multiple tiers with different prerequisites, the requirements for each tier are separated by a slash.

**Description.** This entry simply provides a general idea of what the feat could look like in the story.

**Effect.** This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the feat on the rules of the game.


## Feats List


Below is a complete list of feats available to any character that meets the prerequisites.



## Alternate Form (I - II)

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 2:** None

**Description:** You have the ability to transform from one persona to another, whether that be through bodily transformation like a werewolf or through exterior mechinisms, such as a cybernetically enhanced soldier who can call forth a symbiotic mech suit. \newline

**Effect:** Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat:

-   **Tier 1** - Half of your primary form's attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.

-   **Tier 2** - Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3 feat points per level.

Whenever your primary form gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains points according to the above formulas.
As a focus action, you may change between any two forms (including your primary form or any alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms.
Each form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.
In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30. During combat, Mr. Hyde suffers 10 damage. When he later transforms back into Dr. Jekyll, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from his new maximum, leaving the doctor with 5 out of 15 hit points. Additionally, when changing forms, if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total becomes 1 instead.

**Special:** When selecting feats for your alternate form, you may not select the **Alternate Form** feat.
You may take this feat multiple times. Each time grants you access to an additional form.

## Area Manipulation (I - V)

**Cost:** 1 point
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 5:** None

**Description:** You are exceptionally precise when making area attacks, allowing you to
avoid allies who would otherwise be caught in the line of fire. \newline

**Effect:** For each tier of this feat you possess, you can omit a single 5-foot
square from being targeted as part of an area attack.

## Armor Mastery (I - II)

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 2:** None

**Description:** You are specially trained to wear armor into battle, allowing you to
maximize its protection and minimize its drawbacks. \newline

**Effect:** Your training allows you to sleep in armor without gaining one level of the Fatigued bane. In addition, while wearing armor, you gain the following benefits.

-   **Tier 1** - The Fortitude prerequisite for wearing armor is reduced by 1. When wearing armor, you get a +1 bonus to your Guard defense.

-   **Tier 2** - The Fortitude prerequisite for wearing armor is reduced by 2. When wearing armor, you get a +2 bonus to your Guard defense. Any movement penalty is reduced by 5 feet.

## Attack Redirection

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Defensive Reflexes II

**Description:** You are adept at redirecting your enemy's attacks. Whether using fancy
footwork, magical force, or tactical superiority, you can use your
opponents' attacks against themselves. \newline

**Effect:** When you make a Defend action and your roll exceeds the attacker's
action roll, you can choose to redirect the attack to any target that
could have been hit by the original attack. The original attack roll
does not change, only the target. If the attack was a melee attack, you
can redirect it to anyone within 5' of you (as opposed to within 5' of
the attacker).

## Attack Specialization (I - IX)

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 1
-   **Tier 2:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 2
-   **Tier 3:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 3
-   **Tier 4:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 4
-   **Tier 5:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 5
-   **Tier 6:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 6
-   **Tier 7:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 7
-   **Tier 8:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 8
-   **Tier 9:** Agility, Might, or Any Extraordinary 9

**Description:** You are so well trained with a particular form of attack that you can
devastate foes with much more skill than the average combatant. \newline

**Effect:** When you take this feat, select one weapon or energy type. You gain
Advantage 1 per tier of this feat for any *damaging* attack made with
your choice. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or boon invocations.

Examples of energy types you can choose to specialize in include fire,
cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, creation, and force - though
this list is not exhaustive. \newline

**Special:** You may take this feat multiple times for the same type of
attack. Your total advantage to attacks with the attack is equal to your
tier for that particular attack mode. You can also specialize in
different attacks by purchasing the feat again. For example, a character
might have Attack Specialization (Tier 2) for Fire attacks and Attack
Specialization (Tier 4) for Long Sword.

## Attribute Substitution (I - II)

**Cost:** 2 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 2:** None

**Description:** Your prowess in an extraordinary, mental, or social attribute is
linked in a way that empowers another attribute of your character, allowing you
to use that attribute for tasks normally reserved for another. Examples of
Attribute Substitution in play include a martial artist who is physically weak
but capable of using internal chi to throw and disable opponents, an anatomical
genius who uses their intelligence to make vital strikes rather than their
dexterity, or a gunman who's deadshot aim is the result of a dark pact.

**Effect:** When you purchase this feat, you create a permanent link between two
attributes: one stronger (the primary attribute) and one weaker (the dependent
attribute). You may use your score in the primary attribute in place of the dependent
attribute for different purposes depending on which tier of the feat you have:

-   **Tier 1:**
    -   Making non-attack action rolls
    -   Calculating hit points, defenses, and other secondary statistics
    -   Meeting feat, bane, and boon prerequisites
    -   Other situations at the GM's discretion

-   **Tier 2:**
    -   Making attack action rolls

The relationship formed by your two attributes is subject to case-by-case approval and must be approved by the GM first. The link must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. For example, a bard who subsitutes her Presence for her Might to represent her dance-based melee fighting style would likely not get to use her Presence Score for determining her carrying capacity. Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include an analytical warrior or martial artist who analyzes angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a gunslinger who channels dark energy, giving her deadshot accuracy and substituting Entropy for Agility. \newline

## Bane Focus

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Ability to invoke the chosen bane

**Description:** You are specialized in the use of a particular bane that is iconic to
your character. \newline

**Effect:** Choose a bane that you can invoke. When your roll on a damaging attack exceeds the target's defense by 5 or more (as opposed to the usual 10), you can inflict this bane for free. Each attack is still only capable of inflicting a single bane. When making a bane attack, you get Advantage 2 on the bane attack roll.

## Battle Trance

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Fortitude, or Will 3

entranced, you have advantage 1 on all attacks. Additionally, your Toughness and
Resolve defenses are increased by 3. If your armor bonus is less than 3, it

## Battlefield Sentinel (I - V)

    -   Agility, or Might 5
    -   Battlefield Defender

**Description:** Your battlefield prowess allows you to capitalize on windows of
opportunity that others don't notice, making you far more deadly in
melee combat. \newline

**Effect:** You may make an additional opportunity attack per round for each tier of
this feat your possess. You can only make one opportunity attack per
triggering action (e.g., you cannot make multiple attacks against the
same foe when they leave your threatened space).


## Boon Access

**Cost:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** None

**Description:** You have a special gift: it might be the result of your heritage, a
close encounter with magical energy, or the result of years of training
with a master. In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the
aptitude to work extraordinary powers for yourself or create a desired
effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably
replicate a single boon. \newline

**Effect:** When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the
requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the
Power Level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite
lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your
attribute score as the Power Level of the boon. If the boon has multiple
attribute prerequisite options, you choose one attribute when you take
this feat. Additionally, you count as having access to the chosen boon for
the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for meeting
such prerequisites is equal to the Power Level of the boon. The Boon Access
feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based on character
level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of their feat points
to begin play with access to a Power Level 6 boon.

You may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon. \newline

**Special:** Note that this feat can give access to high-powered boons with a potential for very dramatic impact on the storyline of a game. As such, using this feat to access a boon of Power Level 6 or higher should be approved by the GM before using it in a game.
If you ever meet the attribute prerequisite for the chosen
boon, you may choose at that time to lose this feat and regain the feat
points spent. Re-allocate them as you choose.

## Boon Focus (I - III)

\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 3:** Ability to invoke the chosen boon

**Description:** You are specialized in the use a particular boon that is iconic to your

**Effect:**

-   **Tier 1** - When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.

-   **Tier 2** - You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action, beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.

-   **Tier 3** - The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:  \
\ **If the chosen boon has a duration of "sustain persists"**, you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, one instance of the boon can be sustained each round as a free action, rather than a minor action. If the boon is somehow temporarily canceled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action. If targeted by the *nullify* bane, this effect can only be canceled by a power level 6 or greater invocation of that bane. \
\ **If the boon has a different duration**, you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.

## Breakfall (I - II)

**Cost:** 2 points
\

-   **Tier 2** - As long as you are conscious and able to act, you do not suffer falling damage.

## Brutal Intimidation

\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Might 2

than your social grace. \newline

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 3:** None

**Description:** Whether a hired bodyguard, a loyal animal sidekick, or a sibling that
follows you everywhere, you have the constant and unflinching loyalty of
one particular companion character. \newline

**Effect:** You gain a companion character that acts independently from you. During combat, your companion acts on its own initiative count and gains the usual assortment of actions, which you may choose. You also get to assign your companion's attributes. The companion's highest attribute is determined by your level and your tier in this feat (see below). Your companion also possesses attributes at each number lower than its highest score. For example, if the companion's highest score is 6, then it also has attributes at scores 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. The companion gains no special abilities beyond the feat granted per tier. Whenever you gain a level or purchase a new tier in this feat, you may reassign your companion's attributes and feats.

-   **Tier 1** - Your companion's highest attribute equals your level minus 2 (minimum of 3, maximum of 9). Your companion gains 1 feat, selected from the "Simple Build" NPC feat list in Chapter 7: Running the Game.

-   **Tier 2** - Your companion's highest attribute equals your level minus 1 (minimum of 4, maximum of 9). Your companion gains a 2nd feat from the same list.

-   **Tier 3** - Your companion's highest attribute equals your level (minimum of 5, maximum of 9). Your companion gains a 3rd feat from the same list.

**Example:** Fezzy starts at level one with Companion (Tier II), choosing a wolf for
his companion. Based on Fezzy's level and feat tier, his wolf's highest
attribute is 4, so he can assign the wolf four attributes at scores 4,
3, 2, and 1. He assigns the following: Agility 4, Perception 3, Might 2,
and Fortitude 1. Upon reaching level 2, Fezzy purchases Companion (Tier
III), raising the wolf's highest attribute to 5, so Fezzy reassigns the
attributes as follows: Perception 5, Agility 4, Might 3, Fortitude 2,
Presence 1. \newline

**Special:** If you ever lose your companion, voluntarily or involuntarily, you regain the feat points that you have spent on this feat and may spend them as usual.

## Craft Mundane Item (I - II)

**Cost:** 2 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 2:** Learning 3, or Knowledge I

**Description:** You have mastered a particular craft, and given proper time and
materials, you can create items related to that craft. \newline

**Effect:** Choose a specific craft or profession. You can create items that are
relevant to your chosen craft, and your GM will determine the speed at
which you craft based on the nature of the item and the materials you
have access to. Your tier in the Craft Mundane Item feat determines the maximum
wealth level of the items you can craft. Unlike acquiring items by using
your wealth (described in Chapter 4), crafting does not limit your
ability to acquire additional goods. \newline

-   **Tier 1** - You can craft items equal to your wealth level.

-   **Tier 2** - You can craft items equal to your wealth level + 1.

**Craft Examples** (This list is not exhaustive, and you can work with
your GM to come up with other suitable crafts).

-   Arcane - magical ingredients, inks, scrolls, exotic components

-   Blacksmithing - Metal, leather, weapons, armor, wheels, horseshoes

-   Chemistry - acid, explosives, narcotics

-   Engineering - machines, wheels, gears, guns, vehicles

-   Geography - maps, cartography, instruments of navigation

-   Medicine - medical tools, tonics, tinctures, pain relievers, anti-toxins

-   Herbalism - poultices, natural remedies, stimulants, brewing

## Craft Extraordinary Item (I - III)


**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 3:** Any Extraordinary, or Learning 5

**Description:** You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, brewing potions,
or building extraordinary devices. Their power is permanent but varies
depending on your skill. \newline

**Effect:** Provided you have the appropriate working space and materials (as determined by the GM), you can create extraordinary items. You can only imbue an item with attributes, banes, and boons that you can access. For example, in order to create a sword with Energy 5, you must possess an Energy score of 5 or higher. The only exception to this is if you possess the Creation, Learning, or Logic attributes. These allow you to imbue items with any attribute, bane, or boon as long as their value is less than or equal to your attribute score. The GM may rule that certain uses of Creation, Learning, or Logic are unreasonable when it comes to crafting extraordinary items.

Your tier in this feat determines the maximum Wealth Level of the items you can create, based on the attribute you are using to craft:

-   **Tier 1** - Maximum Wealth Level equals Attribute minus 2
-   **Tier 2** - Maximum Wealth Level equals Attribute minus 1
-   **Tier 3** - Maximum Wealth Level equals Attribute

For example, a character with Creation 5 and tier 1 in this feat could create items up to Wealth Level 3. \
\ You can determine the Wealth Level of the item you want to create by consulting the sample items in **Chapter 8: Rewards** or by developing a custom item using the rules for **Building Your Own Extraordinary Items** in that chapter. \
\ Creating an item with the *consumable* property requires one full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Other items require a duration of uninterrupted work based on their Wealth Level, as follows:

-   **Wealth Level 1 - 3** - Two days per Wealth Level
-   **Wealth Level 4 - 5** - Four days per Wealth Level
-   **Wealth Level 6 - 7** - One week per Wealth Level
-   **Wealth Level 8 - 9** - One month per Wealth Level

At the end of this time, your item is created. Crafting an item still counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient Wealth Score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth provided in **Chapter 4: Wealth & Equipment**. The GM may waive some or all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a suit of Armor of Resistance (Fire), the GM may decide that the dragon’s hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor’s wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.

strike down your enemies with ferocious blows. \newline

**Effect:** While you are in a battle trance, in addition to dice exploding on any

number 1 below maximum as well (though the total is still the number rolled).
This means that d4s explode on a 3 or 4, d6s explode on a 5 or 6, d8s explode on
a 7 or 8, and so on.

or an animal familiar. You cannot use the selected extraordinary
attribute without your focus. However, for the purposes of determining
your attribute dice for action rolls, treat the chosen attribute as if
it was one greater. For all purposes outside of attribute dice, your
ability score remains unchanged (feats, banes, boons, etc.). \newline

**Special:** If you ever lose your extraordinary focus, voluntarily or
involuntarily, you regain the feat points that you have spent on this
feat and may spend them as usual.

phantasmal figments, but to completely dominate the sensory perceptions

hallucination within a target's mind instead of an illusion that is
perceptible to everyone. You gain complete control over the target's
senses (as granted by the Power Level of your bane), and are thus the
hallucination is not restricted by size or area. Your hallucination may
only target a single creature, and thus is not eligible for
multi-targeting attacks.

## Hallucination - Mass

\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:**
    -   Influence 7
    -   Hallucination

## Heightened Invocation (I - III)

**Cost:** 2 points

-   **Tier 2:** Any Extraordinary 6
-   **Tier 3:** Any Extraordinary 9

**Description:** By channeling your extraordinary powers through extensive rituals, such
as meditation, fasting, blood letting, and sacrifices, you are able to
increase the strength of your invocations. \newline

**Effect:** When invoking a bane or boon, you may choose to do so as a heightened invocation. The invocation time for a heightened invocation is one increment higher than usual as follows:

-   1 action becomes 1 minute
-   1 minute becomes 10 minutes
-   10 minutes becomes 1 hour
-   1 hour becomes 8 hours
-   8 hours becomes 24 hours

**Tier 1** - When performing a heightened invocation, you may choose one of the following effects to empower your bane or boon:

-   Increase the range of the effect as follows:
    -   Attribute 5 = 500ft
    -   Attribute 6 = 1/2 mile
    -   Attribute 7 = 1 mile
    -   Attribute 8 = 10 miles
    -   Attribute 9 = 100 miles
-   Negate two levels of disadvantage caused by multi-targeting (e.g., target 2 creatures or a 10' square for free instead of disadvantage 2).
-   For your action roll, treat your attribute score as if it was one greater for purposes of determining attribute dice. Note that this doesn't grant access to banes or boons you could not normally access. It only increases the dice used for the action roll.

**Tier 2** - You gain the following options when you perform a heightened invocation:

-   You can lead others to join you in group invocation as long as they are also able to invoke the bane or boon at the same power level that you are invoking it at. At the conclusion of the group invocation, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.
-   You gain the following additional options to choose from when empowering your invocations with heightened invocation:
    -   Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without needing to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot end the boon through use of a disrupting attack (though the <em>nullify</em> bane still works).
    -   Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute after it is invoked.

**Tier 3** - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the invocation process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the invocation and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active heightened invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the invocation was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll as follows:

-   **Bestow Boon** - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will with a free action, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily with the  *nullify* bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).
-   **Bestow Bane** - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be canceled either temporarily with the *nullify* bane, bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that follows).
-   **Dispel Boon** - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the boon automatically.
-   **Dispel Bane** - Make a Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though your target gains no special immunity to it.

\
**Prerequisites:**

who exclusively wields his favored pistols, your training is
hyper-focused on a single style of combat to the exclusion of all
others. \newline

**Effect:** Choose a single weapon (or choose unarmed combat), and specify the
attribute that your martial focus relies upon: agility or might. When
making attacks using your chosen weapon, your attribute is considered 1
greater for the purposes of determining attribute dice. Your attribute
is not changed for purposes of feats, banes, boons, or similar items.
Because of your intense focus on a single combat style, any attacks that
you make which do not use your martial focus suffer disadvantage 1.

## Master Tracker

**Cost:** 1 point
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Perception 4

**Description:** Your skill at tracking and hunting your quarry is unmatched, allowing
you to follow trails long after others would have lost them. \newline

direction of true north. In addition, once you successfully locate the
trail of a target, you automatically succeed at all tracking attempts to
continue following that trail for 7 days after the time you first picked

exceptional cases can cause you to lose your mark.

## Mimic

**Cost:** 2 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:**
    -   Alteration 4
    -   Deception 3

**Description:** You have honed your shapeshifting abilities to be able to not only
change your form, but to even imitate specific creatures. Your powers
may stem from studying the arts of deceptive magic, from a gene
mutation, or even from innate extraordinary abilities. \newline

**Effect:** When you use the Shapeshift boon, you may take on the features of a
specific creature. For example, instead of merely transforming into an
elf, you can assume the guise of Galdion the elven king. The disguise is
near perfect for those examining you visually. If your behavior or other
signs provide reasonable suspicion, an onlooker can attempt a Perception
check with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + triple your Alteration or
Deception score, whichever is higher. If they succeed, they will
recognize your disguise.

## Multi-Attack Specialist (I - VI)

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 6:** None

**Description:** Whether your are delivering flurry of blows, wielding two weapons, or
calling a chain of lightning bolts from the sky, you have mastered the
art of delivering multiple attacks. \newline

**Effect:** Before attacking, you may declare that you are multi-attacking, and must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. ALL of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of **additional** attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 3; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 6). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1.

You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging
attacks, but you may not invoke boons. Resolve each attack individually,
applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move
between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same
creature more than once.

The number of additional attacks you can make with this feat is limited to 1 + half your level, rounded up. Thus, the limit is 2 additional attacks at 1st level, 3 additional attacks at 3rd level, and 6 additional attacks at 9th level. \newline

**Example:** Vax the Deathbringer has Multi Attack Specialist (Tier III). He declares
that he will be making three attacks this round (two additional attacks). Therefore, all of his
attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 2 = 6, minus 3 for feat tier 3). His
first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10' square. Because of
the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his
total disadvantage for that attack 5. For his second attack, Vax casts a
spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at
disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his
touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional
disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of
disadvantage 6.

## Multi-Bane Specialist

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Able to inflict both banes (see description)

**Description:** You have mastered a signature attack that allows you to invoke two banes
at once. A blast of ice that blinds and slows your enemy, a thunderous
shotgun blast that hurls foes back and knocks them to the ground, and a
wormtongue song that puts targets to sleep and alters their memory are
all examples of a signature attack that could be created with this feat. \newline

**Effect:** Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining knockdown and slowed, both power level 1, would require an attribute score of 2). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately. \newline

**Special:** In order to benefit from the bane focus feat when using a multi-bane attack, you must possess bane focus for both banes.


## Multi-Target Attack Specialist (I - V)

**Cost:** 2 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 5:** None

a whirlwind of your blade, a hail of arrows, or a ball of flame. \newline

**Effect:** When you choose this feat, you must decide to focus in area, projectile,
or melee attacks. For each tier, you reduce the disadvantage penalty
associated with multi-targeting for your chosen attack type by 1. Whenever
you take this feat, you must specify which type of attack you are
focusing on, and you may take the feat multiple times to specialize in
multiple types of attack.

invoke certain boons effortlessly. \newline

**Effect:** When multi-targeting a boon for which you have the Boon Focus feat, you
do not need to make an action roll if the disadvantage normally incurred
from multi-targeting is completely negated by your Multi-Target Boon
Specialist feat. Your invocation automatically succeeds.

## Multi-Target Boon Specialist (I - V)

\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1 - 5:** None

lifetime of conditioning, your skin is tough as nails, allowing your
body to deflect blows that would cripple others. \newline

Guard defense. Your armor bonus is determined by your tier in this feat:

\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Ability to invoke the chosen bane

**Description:** You are so adept at a particular form of attack that your foes struggle
to shake off the effects. Perhaps the flames of your fireballs burn
hotter. Or maybe you've developed a special chemical to mix in with your
blinding powder. Whatever the source and whatever the effect, your
enemies cower before your legendary attack. \newline

**Effect:** Choose one bane that you can invoke that has a duration of "resist
ends". When a target rolls Resist to shake off your invocation of
the chosen bane, they have disadvantage 1.

## Reactionary Trance

**Cost:** 2 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:**
    -   Will 5
    -   Battle Trance

**Description:** Your battle trance lies dormant just below the surface, waiting to be unleashed at a moment's notice. \newline

**Effect:** You can enter a battle trance (as per the Battle Trance feat) as a
free action even when it is not your turn. You may choose to do so in reaction to
another action, such as an enemy's attack, spell, or insult. You may even declare
your intent to enter a battle trance after the action has been resolved (such as
after the attack has already been rolled). The benefits granted from your battle
trance take place before the triggering action is resolved, potentially negating
damage or harmful effects that you would have otherwise incurred.

## Reckless Frenzy

**Cost:** 3 points
\
**Prerequisites:**

-   **Tier 1:** Battle Trance

**Description:** By willingly punishing your own body, you can enter a frenzy that allows you to launch a relentless onslaught of attacks. \newline

**Effect:** While you are in a battle trance, on your turn you may choose to
inflict 5 hit points of damage on yourself to make an additional attack as a minor
action. Effects that prevent or reduce damage cannot effect this self-inflicted damage.
You suffer the damage before making your extra attack, so you must have at least 6 hit
points remaining to make use of this feat.

\

# Wealth & Equipment #

No story of heroic deeds is complete without equally heroic gear, weapons and armor. Indiana Jones had his whip, King Arthur had *Excalibur*, and Bilbo had his mithril shirt. In this chapter, you'll learn everything you need to know about how to equip your character at first level and beyond, as well as how to keep track of your wealth as you capture dragon hoards and seize kingdoms.

## Wealth
Rather than tracking every gold piece, gem, and fine art object that you acquire over the course of your adventures, Open Legend uses a simplified wealth system.

Every character has a Wealth Score, which begins at 2 and can range from 0 to 9, fluctuating up and down as you acquire and spend your riches. Your wealth score provides a general description of how well-off you are and the typical types of goods and services you can acquire. The Wealth Overview table describes the typical lifestyles and available goods for each Wealth Score.

### Acquiring Goods and Services
When you are trying to buy new equipment, construct a building, or hire a craftsman, your wealth score determines whether you are able. Every good or service is assigned a Wealth Level (either in the rules or by the GM). This level is compared with your Wealth Score in order to determine the cost of acquiring the item, as follows:

If the good you want to purchase has a level lower than your Wealth Score, you can acquire the item easily without taxing your time and resources.

If the item's level is **equal to** your Wealth Score, you can acquire it, but the expense taxes your resources such that you cannot acquire new goods at that level or higher for two weeks.

If the object of your purchase is **one level higher than** your Wealth Score and your Wealth Score is above 0, you can acquire it, but the cost is so great that your Wealth Score is reduced by 1.

You cannot make purchases that are more than one level higher than your Wealth Score.

#### Wealth Overview

\ \

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.15}OCT{.35}OLT{.50}}

| Wealth Score | Sample Lifestyles | Sample Goods |
| :-: | :----- | :----- |
| 0 | beggar, street urchin | 3 square meals and a warm bed |
| 1 | unskilled laborer | a night on the town, leather armor, simple weapons |
| 2 | skilled laborer, town guardsman, 1st level hero | martial weapons, all-terrain vehicle, chainmail armor, a good horse |
| 3 | master artisan, village mayor | armored trenchcoat, silver bullets, a small boat, a fine horse, a nice car |
| 4 | 4th level hero, noble, city mayor | elven full plate, a light tank, a small ship, a siege engine |
| 5 | lord of a realm, mob boss in a large city | a large cargo ship, a city wall, a heavily armored tank, weapons to outfit a small militia |
| 6 | 7th level hero, Federation Chancellor | a large warship, a groundbreaking prototype, the workforce of a medium-sized business  |
| 7 | king, president | a stronghold, a jet fighter, an elite covert task force |
| 8 | intergalactic ruler, 10th level hero | a sprawling estate, a large corporate buyout, an army of 10,000 |
| 9 | supreme emperor | a castle, a space station, an army of 50,000, a fleet of warships |

**The Rule of Common Sense**. Your Wealth Score determines which purchases are possible given the proper circumstances. Obviously, if you are in the middle of a desert, you can't buy a keg of water even if you have the wealth of an emperor. Likewise, even though you have enough money to raise an army, the GM may rule that you still require the appropriate amount of time, effort, and charisma to convince the soldiers to follow you.

### Gaining Wealth

As you travel the stars, slay mythic beasts, and win over affluent nobles, your wealth will increase. The GM decides when a character's wealth increases, and the Wealth Overview table provides a few milestones of typical character Wealth Scores at different levels.

Typical situations of when the GM would grant you an increase in your Wealth Score include acquiring a large hoard from a monster's lair, finding a buyer for an item of great power or value, or being rewarded by a great ruler.

## Carrying Capacity

*Open Legend* is about rolling dice, telling epic stories, and having a good time. So the rules for determining how much you can carry are purposefully simplified so that you and your friends can spend your time on what matters: the game.

### Twenty Items Max

You can carry up to twenty pieces of gear. No more. Only track the items that will actually affect the game. So, no, you don't need to record your pants and shirt on your character sheet. But, your armor does count.

Multiple items of a similar nature that can be stowed together, such as twenty arrows in a quiver or a belt of healing potions, only count as a single item. The GM can use their own discretion to apply common sense limits if necessary. For example, even though technically 1000 clips of ammo would count as a single item, the GM is free to rule that a PC can't carry them or that they would count as a *bulky* item (see below).

### Maximum *Heavy* Items Equals Might Score

Some items have the *heavy* property. You can carry a number of *heavy* items equal to your Might score. Once you're carrying your maximum number of *heavy* items, your speed is cut in half. A character with a zero Might score cannot carry any heavy items.

### One (Maybe Two) *Bulky* Items

Some items have the *bulky* property. You can carry one *bulky* item at no penalty. You can carry a second *bulky* item, but your speed is reduced to 5'.

Tech Levels provide a simplified way of defining the technology available to a given society. Open Legend uses the following four tech levels to broadly categorize the technological advances that a society can make:

TL 0 - Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Medieval Age
TL 1 - Modern Age
TL 2 - Near Future (mechs, cyborgs, laser weapons)
TL 3 - Far Future (intergalactic space travel, nanotechnology, quantum-powered technology)

When planning a campaign, the GM can specify which tech level (or levels) the campaign will use. For example, a typical sword and sorcery campaign would be set at tech level 0, while a steampunk campaign would probably use a good mix of tech levels 0 and 1.

**Mixing Tech Levels**
You may encounter situations in which one group has a significant technological advantage over another group, such as an intergalactic empire (tech level 3) waging war upon a primitive civilization (tech level 0). In cases like these, the GM may assign blanket advantage or disadvantage to actions equal to the difference of the opposing tech levels. Using the previous example, the primitive civilization would receive disadvantage 3 on all actions in which the technology disparity plays an important role, while the intergalactic empire would receive advantage 3 on such actions.

## Weapons & Implements

In this section you will find the tools needed to pick weapons and armor that your character will use in battle. The first half is a simplified weapon and armor creation table that can help to guide you to the right choice that makes the most sense for your Character. The second half is a more complex area for making more specific weapons.

*Open Legend does not insist that every weapon be equal in terms of the mechanical benefits in using it, thus some weapons will be seen more often, since they offer more advantages to the wielder than other weapons.*

**Examples** are a few weapons or armor that could reflect this category. It is not an exhaustive list by any means, but simply something to get your brain working. Feel free to discuss with your GM about other items that would make sense.

**Category** is the general group that the weapon falls into. Some weapons may fall into multiple categories. If a weapon falls into multiple categories, for each attack, the wielder must choose the mode being used and the attack gains the benefits of that category. For example a dagger is both “Close Ranged” and “One-handed Melee”. On each attack, the wielder chooses the mode.


* **Melee** - weapons in this category are meant for close quarters hand-to-hand combat.

    * **One-handed Melee** - The weapon uses a single hand and allows the other hand to be used for carrying another object, second weapon, or kept free for other actions. When wielding a one-handed weapon in each hand, you gain advantage 1 to all melee attacks; with two weapons, you have a better chance of capitalizing on openings in your target's defense. If both weapons you are wielding have passive benefits such as the Deadly or Defensive properties, your benefit is the best of the two but does not stack.
    * **Two-Handed Melee** - The weapon requires two hands to wield and cannot be used with a shield or other weapon. Two-handed melee weapons grant advantage 1 to all attacks; blows delivered with both hands are usually more deadly.
    * **Versatile Melee** - The weapon can be wielded either one-handed or two-handed. The wielder can freely switch between the two modes and has all of the benefits and restrictions of whichever mode they are using.

* **Ranged** - Weapons in this category can be used to make ranged attacks with no penalty up to their range increment (in feet). Attacks made up to twice the normal range suffer disadvantage 1, and attacks made up to three times the normal range suffer disadvantage 2. Attacks at farther distances cannot be made. Note that ammunition for ranged weapons is generally not kept track of, as it is assumed you have brought enough ammo with you. A weapon like a rocket launcher should be handled as one-time use, consumable extraordinary item.
    * **Range Increments**

        * **Close Ranged** - Range increment of 25'.
        * **Short Ranged** - Range increment of 50'.
        * **Medium Ranged** - Range increment of 75'.
        * **Long Ranged** - Range increment of 125'.
        * **Extreme Ranged** - Range increment of 300'.

    * **Close** and **Short** Ranged weapons are built to be compact and effective in close quarters, so they are less bulky. They can be wielded with a single hand, allowing the other hand to be used for carrying a shield, second weapon, or kept free for other actions.
    * **Medium**, **Long**, and **Extreme** Ranged weapons have various strengths, but are not built for close quarters combat. As such, they require two hands and cannot be used with any weapon or other item in the wielders off hand.
    * **Extreme** Ranged weapons are built for distance and given their specialized calibration, cannot be used to attack a target closer than 50'.

**WL (Wealth Level)** is an indication of how expensive the item is to purchase. See the **Wealth** section earlier in this chapter for an explanation of how that works.

**Properties** are the descriptors that make each weapon unique from others. These properties translate to specific game mechanics described below.

**Banes** indicate specific banes that the weapon is particularly effective at inflicting. When an attacker uses the weapon to inflict one of the listed banes, they may treat the Power Level as reduced by one for purposes of meeting bane invocation attribute prerequisites, which the attacker still must meet. In addition, if you make a bane attack with the weapon, you get advantage 1 on the attack. Some special weapons list banes not normally invoked via Agility or Might. In those cases, the attacking attribute can be used to invoke the bane.

### Properties

**Area** - An area weapon always makes multi-target area attacks of the listed size and shape aand cannot be used to make non-area attacks. If a weapon has multiple area sizes, the attacker chooses from them with each attack. These attacks do not incur any of the disadvantage penalties associated with multi-target attacks.

**Consumable** - A consumable weapon breaks the usual rules of not tracking inventory. Each one occupies an inventory slot and attacking with the weapon consumes it, not to be used again.

**Deadly** - Some weapons are so effective that their potency makes the wielder significantly more capable. Attacks made with this weapon gain advantage equal to their deadly value. A weapon cannot have a Deadly value greater than 3.

**Defensive** - A defensive weapon grants advantage equal to its value when its wielder takes the Defend action. While wielding an item with the Defensive property, you do not gain the advantage 1 to attacks normally associated with Melee One-handed or Two-handed weapons. A weapon cannot have a Defensive value greater than 3. Wielding any Defensive weapon grants a +1 armor bonus regardless of its Defensive value. This bonus does not stack with multiple Defensive weapons.

**Delayed Ready** - the weapon cannot be used more than once per round. In addition, prior to using the weapon, the wielder must spend a move action to ready it.

**Forceful** - This weapon can be used to make attacks with the Might attribute and invoke banes accessible via Might.

**Heavy** - The weapon is particularly heavy to carry. You may carry a maximum number of *heavy* items equal to your Might score.

**Precise** - This weapon can be used to make attacks with the Agility attribute  and invoke banes accessible via Agility.

**Reach** - This weapon extends the natural melee range of the creature by 5'.

**Slow** - If you are wielding this weapon at the beginning of combat, you gain disadvantage 2 on your initiative roll. If you are not wielding the weapon but plan to use it on your first turn, this penalty is applied. If you are wielding multiple weapons, your initiative modifier is equal to the slowest among them (slow, swift, or neither).

**Stationary** - the bulk and weight of this weapon is enormous. Moving it requires a Focus Action from an assisting character which transports the weapon 30'.

**Swift** - If you are wielding this weapon at the beginning of combat, you gain advantage 2 on your initiative roll. If you are not wielding the weapon but plan to use it on your first turn, you get this bonus. If you are wielding multiple weapons, your initiative modifier is equal to the slowest among them (slow, swift, or neither).




## Armor

Armor provides a bonus to your Guard defense, thus reducing or negating the damage that you would suffer from many types of attacks.

Armor comes in 3 types: light, medium, and heavy in terms of the protection they offer, ranging from a +1 to +3 bonus to your Guard defense. The examples below are general guidelines, feel free to create your own names, but armor should not grant a bonus greater than +3 to defense.

The Armor table summarizes the following properties of each type of armor:

**Required Fortitude** lists the minimum Fortitude attribute score that a character requires in order to wear the armor. Without the appropriate Fortitude score, a character cannot benefit from the protection afforded by the armor.

**Defense Bonus** indicates the bonus that your character gains to their Guard defense.

**Speed Penalty** indicates the reduction in speed that your character suffers due to the bulkiness and weight of the armor.

Donning and removing armor takes 1 round for light armor, 1 minute for medium armor, and 10 minutes for heavy armor. Sleeping in medium or heavy armor is only possible with special training. Without the Armor Mastery feat, sleeping in armor causes your character to gain one level of the Fatigued bane, which applies disadvantage 1 to all action rolls until they get a proper night's rest.

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.25}OCT{.15}OCT{.15}OCT{.15}OCT{.15}OCT{.15}}

\SpanningTable[tbp]

| Examples | Type | Wealth Level | Required Fortitude | Defense Bonus | Speed Penalty |
| :----- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Leather Armor, Steelsilk, Padded Armor | Light | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Armored Trenchcoat, Electropolymer Armor | Medium | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| Chainmail, Kevlar Vest, Breastplate | Medium | 2 | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| Yoroi Armor, Plate Mail, Riot Suit | Heavy | 2 | 3 | 3 | 5' |
| Power Armor, Elven Plate Mail | Heavy | 4 | 1 | 3 | 0 |



### Getting in and out of Your Armor

Donning and removing armor takes 1 round for light armor, 1 minute for medium armor, and 10 minutes for heavy armor. Sleeping in medium or heavy armor is only possible with special training. Without the Armor Mastery feat, sleeping in armor causes your character to gain one level of the Fatigued bane, which applies disadvantage 1 to all non-attack rolls until they get a proper night's rest.

## Building Your Own Weapons

Previously, we detailed the mechanical benefits of a variety of sample weapons. But you may be interested in making your character or campaign setting unique by creating stats for your own home brewed weapons. To do so, simply follow the five step process explained in this section. Every weapon begins with a default wealth level of 1, and may be increased or decreased at various stages of this process.

### Step 1: Choose a Category

Typically a weapon belongs to one category, however some weapons, such as a dagger or a hybrid sword-gun might fall into two categories. No weapon should fall into more than two categories, but selecting either one or two categories is at the discretion of the player and GM. This step has no impact on the weapon's cost.

### Step 2: Choose Properties

Every weapon must have either the *Forceful* or *Precise* property and some weapons have both. Choose one or both.

Next, choose any additional properties that the weapon possesses. Properties adjust the wealth level according to the following table.

| Property | WL Modifier |
| :-: | :-: |
| Area | + disadvantage penalty incurred by the area via multi-targeting (see Chapter 7: Combat) |
| Defensive | + *defensive* value |
| Delayed Ready | -1 |
| Expendable | -1 |
| Heavy | 0 |
| Reach | +1 |
| Slow | -1 |
| Stationary | -1 |
| Swift | +1 |

### Step 3: Choose Banes

Weapons are distinguished in terms of combat style and effectiveness by the banes associated with them. Banes do not impact wealth level, and a typical weapon will have 2 or 3 associated banes. Weapons with 4 or more associated banes must be approved by the GM.

### Step 4: Calculate Wealth Level

All weapons (with the exception of unarmed strike), begin with a base wealth level of 1. From there, calculate the wealth level of the weapon based on the decisions from your choices in Step 2 and Step 3.

### Step 5: Check With Your GM

Although we've shown how to calculate the Wealth Level of an item based on how powerful it is, the fact remains that many weapons have story value that should not be undermined. A sniper rifle might only have the capabilities of a Wealth Level 1 weapon, but it is expertly crafted and should be beyond the means of a Wealth Level 1 character. You'll notice on the weapons table that it's listed at Wealth Level 2. GMs should also feel free to adjust Wealth Level until it feels correct. Obviously a typical dagger (comes to Wealth Level 2 with the formula), is not worth more than a typical short sword (comes to Wealth Level 1). Similarly, a weapon with the Area 9 property may be powerful, but it does not have the same value as the army of 50,000 mentioned in the Wealth Level 9 example expenditures.


#### Weapon Building Example: Kusari-Gama (Chain & Sickle)

Let's build our own weapon as an example. The kusaria-gama is a very unique weapon from Japanese history which is a combination of a chain and a kama (typical farming implement).

**Step 1 (Choose a Category)** - While the kusari-gama might typically be used as a short bladed melee weapon, it can also be swung via its long chain. As such, we will give it both the *one-handed melee* and *close ranged* categories.

**Step 2 (Choose Properties)** - Because the kusari-gama could be wielded either with nimble precision or a mighty swing of the chain or sickle, we will give it both the *precise* and *forceful* properties. For extra flavor, we will say that the chain's ability to intercept and deflect attacks gives it the *defensive 1* property, and also the *reach* property for striking at a distance. Lastly, swinging the weapon is very time-consuming, so we will give it the *slow* property.

**Step 3 (Choose Banes)** - In terms of combat style, the kusari-gama can be used to pull, trip, entangle, and threaten enemies in a wide area, as such we will say it has the following banes associated: *forced move*, *immobile*, *knockdown*, and *provoked*.

**Step 4 (Calculate Wealth Level)** - The total wealth level modifier of the properties chosen in step 2 is +1. Added to the base wealth level of 1, we arrive at a final wealth level of 2 for our kusari-gama.

**Step 5 (Check With Your GM)** - Does the GM approve? Hopefully. We would hate to disagree with them.



## Mounts & Vehicles

In this section, you'll find rules for mounting upon your battle-bred warhorse or piloting your trusty old fighter ship. For mechanical purposes, mounts and vehicles are handled the same. These rules will apply whenever a character is riding upon or within another creature or object as their primary form of movement. You will move with your mount (see mount actions below), but otherwise you are considered separate for purposes of targeting, boons, banes, and similar situations.

Throughout this text, the words “mount” and “vehicle” are used interchangeably. Mechanically speaking, the rules are the same whether you are riding a pony or a star fighter, so any references to “mount” also apply to “vehicles”, and vice-versa.

### Mount Actions

When mounted, you may allocate any of your actions to your mount instead of yourself. For example, while riding a velociraptor, you could spend your move action to have your raptor move 40'. Whenever your mount moves, you move with it. Likewise, instead of attacking with your own weapons, you could spend your major action to let your raptor make an attack. Your mount will have its own attributes and feats, so it will not benefit from your feats or attributes.

Typically, mounts and vehicles cannot act independently of their riders, and so they will only get to take actions when their rider allocates actions to them.

### Example Mounts & Vehicles

Detailed below are a variety of mounts and vehicles for characters to carry characters across land, sea, and sky. These samples represent multiple genres and are not meant to be an exhaustive list. GMs and players should use these examples as guidelines and work together to create stats for additional mounts as necessary to fit their campaigns.


**WL (Wealth Level)** indicates the Wealth Level associated with this particular mount or vehicle. Acquiring one requires a sufficient Wealth Level and follows all of the rules for Wealth established in Chapter 4 Wealth & Equipment.

**Speed** indicates the number of feet the mount or vehicle moves with a single move action.

**Properties** are the descriptors that make each mount unique from others. These properties translate to specific game mechanics described below.

**Attributes** indicates the notable attributes possessed by the vehicle or mount. At the GM's discretion, other attributes can be granted on an as-needed basis.

**Feats** indicates the feats which the mount or vehicle possesses to highlight its unique capabilities. These feats only apply to actions taken by the mount, not actions made by the rider.

**HP (Hit Points)** indicates the total hit points possessed by the vehicle or mount.

**DT (Damage Threshold)** is an indication of how much punishment the mount or vehicle can take. When a vehicle reaches zero hit points, it gains one damage level and its hit points return to maximum. Any remaining damage is carried over to the its new hit point total, thus a vehicle can suffer multiple damage levels from a single attack if it deals enough damage. A mount has disadvantage equal to its damage level on all action rolls. Once the mount's damage level reaches its damage threshold, it is disabled (unable to act) until healed or repaired. Repairing or healing one damage level requires 1 day per wealth level of the vehicle.

**Defenses** are the Toughness, Guard, and Resolve defenses of the vehicle or mount. If "Immune" is listed for a given defense, then attacks targeting that defense have no effect.


#### Properties

**Faster than Light** - The vehicle is capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. Doing so requires that a pilot expend a focus action on three consecutive rounds.

**Guided Weapons** - Attacks made with this vehicle are particularly difficult to evade. When the vehicle makes an attack using an attribute greater than zero, it rolls an additional d20 and keeps the higher die. This benefit only applies to attacks that target an opponent's Guard defense.

**Multi-Pilot** - The vehicle can be piloted by a number of people equal to the value indicated. Each pilot can make use of the vehicle to make actions, but no more than 2 move actions can be taken by the vehicle in each round.

**Independent** - A mount or vehicle with this property is capable of acting on its own, without the instructions of its controller. It receives a number of major actions every round equal to the value indicated. These cannot be used to perform move actions. The rider may still assign actions to the mount as usual.

**Targeted Weapons** - A vehicle with this property is more potent in the hands of a skilled operator. If the pilot's Agility score is greater than the attacking attribute score of the vehicle, attacks receive advantage equal to the difference. Attacks are still made by the vehicle and not the pilot.

# Banes and Boons

Banes and boons are a huge part of what makes *Open Legend* so open. They represent the endless possibilities of effects that your character can have on other characters beyond simply dealing damage. Banes are negative conditions that you inflict upon your foes, such as by stunning them, demoralizing them, or setting them on fire. Boons are the opposite: helpful effects that assist your allies by allowing them to fly, shrug off damage, or move with extraordinary speed.

Banes and boons are not tied to specific spells, attacks, or items. Any character can invoke any bane or boon as long as the character possesses the prerequisite attributes. Attribute prerequisites are meant to limit the power of banes and boons so that they scale as your character gains power. That is why, for example, your first level necromancer can invoke the *Blindsight* boon with their Entropy attribute of 5, but won't be able to invoke the *Insubstantial* boon for themself or their allies until they gain enough experience to increase their Entropy to 7.

A list of available banes and boons can be found in this SRD under the [banes section](#banes-list) and [boons section](#boons-list) and a searchable and filterable list of available banes and boons can be found on the [Open Legend Website](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/), respectively.

## Telling Your Story with Banes and Boons

Because *Open Legend* focuses on separating the mechanics from the story, when you invoke a bane or boon, you get to decide what it looks like in the narrative. For example, did you *Knockdown* a foe with an agile sweep kick, a herculean shove, or a telekinetic thrust? When you grant your allies *Resistance*, do they become coated in armor of ice or are they protected by a swarm of robotic droids that hover around their body and deflect attacks?

### With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility

When you browse these lists, you will find that your attributes grant access to far more banes and boons than you could typically make use of. Sometimes, attributes can mean different things for different types of characters. For example, imagine using the *Alteration* attribute to invoke the *Shapeshift* boon - a Druid would do so to turn into a massive bear, while a genetically enhanced military operative might assume the identity of a high profile enemy commander. These examples of using *Shapeshift* make sense and follow our normal expectations from similar stories, but *Alteration* also grants access to the *Invisible* boon. This can be confusing, because having access to a bane or boon might make you feel that you should use it, but that's not necessarily the case. The best time to use a bane or boon is when it adds to the story and makes the game more fun for everyone.

In *Open Legend*, we use the rules to make sure the game is fair and that everyone gets equal opportunity to drive the story forward - we don't use the rules to ensure the game is logical. Whether or not a story makes sense or is enjoyable is a matter of personal preference. *Open Legend* expects that these details will be worked out between the players and the GM during a game. Certain attributes give you access to an incredible toolbox of banes and boons, but it is the responsibility of everyone playing the game to respect each other's wish to tell a story that the group can get excited about. So, while your Druid with *Alteration* might not have a good excuse to become *Invisible*, the rules make it possible just in case, and in the process it also becomes possible to play an alien psychic warrior that uses *Alteration* to bend waves of light and become *Invisible*.

## Invoking Banes and Boons

To invoke a bane, the primary method is to succeed at an appropriate attribute roll using one of your target's defense scores as the Challenge Rating, as indicated in the bane description. An alternate method of invoking a bane is to make a successful damaging attack that exceeds the target's defense by 10 or more. When this happens, you may apply one bane of a Power Level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target. While targets may be effected by multiple banes, you may not *stack* banes; A target cannot be inflicted with a bane it is currently suffering from, unless specified in the bane's effect (*e.g.* *Fatigued*).

To invoke a boon, you must succeed at an appropriate attribute roll with a Challenge Rating determined by the boon's Power Level. The CR equals 10 + 2 x Power Level. If a boon can be invoked at multiple Power Levels, you decide which Power Level to invoke at after making your action roll. While targets may be effected by different boons, you may not *stack* the same boon multiple times; if a second invocation of a boon would be applied to a character, they choose which boon to keep and which one to negate.

Additional details about invoking banes and boons, such as attack range and targeting multiple creatures, can be found in Chapter 6: Combat.

## Reading a Bane Description

Each bane description includes the following elements.

**Power Level.** This number indicates the required attribute score needed to inflict the bane. If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2 / 4 / 6), then the bane can be inflicted at multiple tiers of power. The *Persistent Damage* bane, for example, deals increased damage as you inflict it at higher power levels.

**Attack Attributes.** This is a list of the attribute or attributes that can be used to inflict the bane. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the Power Level, then you can inflict the bane.

**Attack.** This list indicates what type of attack roll to make when inflicting the bane. Each entry consists of an attribute that the attacking player should roll and the defense score targeted by the attack. If the attacker's roll equals or exceeds the target's defense score, then the bane is inflicted.

**Duration.** A bane typically remains in effect until the target resists it with a resist roll, hence most banes have a duration of “resist ends”. If a target fails three resist rolls against a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted. It persists for an extended duration indicated in parentheses.

**Description.** This entry simply provides a general idea of what the bane could look like in the story.

**Effect.** This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the bane on the rules of the game.

Below is a complete list of banes available to any character that meets the Power Level prerequisite.

-   Creation vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Guard
-   Entropy vs. Toughness

**Description:** You blind your foe with anything from a massive explosion, to a handful of sand, to an arctic blast, to a dazzling flash of light. \newline

**Effect:** The target cannot see as long as the effect persists. The target automatically fails any Perception rolls based solely on normal sight. Attack rolls and Perception rolls based partially on sight that can be supplemented by another sense suffer disadvantage 5. The target's Guard defense is reduced by 3.

## Charmed

**Duration:** Resist ends (special) (Fail x 3 = 24 hours)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 4, 6
\
**Attack Attributes:** Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** Charms are one of the great banes of legend, wielded by powerful
enchantresses like Circe (in Homer's The Odyssey), nymphs, and other
enchanters who control the will of others, not through total domination,
but through a magical spell of love or friendship. \newline

**Effect:** The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging
attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The *charmed* bane
manifests at two levels: minor and major.

**Minor Charm** - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately. If they are about to strike you, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation goes away.

**Major Charm** - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The attacker is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.

The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.

-   **Power Level 3** - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.

-   **Power Level 4** - You can Minor Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence. You can Major Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.

-   **Power Level 6** - You can Major Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence.

**Special:** While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24
hours.

## Deafened

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 4
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Energy, Entropy
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Toughness
-   Entropy vs. Toughness

**Description:** You deafen your foe with a crash of thunder, a deft strike to their ears, or a dark energy that disables their hearing. \newline

**Effect:** The target cannot hear as long as the effect persists. The target automatically fails any Perception rolls based solely on hearing. Perception rolls based partially on hearing that can be supplemented by another sense suffer disadvantage 3.

## Death

**Duration:** Resist ends (special) (Fail x 3 = Permanent)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Entropy
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Toughness
-   Entropy vs. Toughness

**Description:** Utilizing either incredible precision or the power of entropy, you snuff out the target's life force completely. \newline

**Effect:**  Upon a successful invocation, the target is immediately rendered immobile, unconscious, and unable to take actions. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls, and any damaging attacks against them count as finishing blows.

If the target fails three resist rolls to shake off this bane, they die. The death is permanent and can only be reversed if the GM allows a special mission to use rare technology or long-forgotten magic to restore the target to life. \newline

**Special:** While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane renders the target incapable of taking actions and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the targets body fights to regain consciousness and resist the impending death. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When the target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

## Demoralized

**Duration:** Resist (minor) ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 6, 8
\

-   Agility vs. Resolve
-   Energy vs. Resolve
-   Entropy vs. Resolve
-   Influence vs. Resolve
-   Might vs. Resolve
-   Persuasion vs. Resolve
-   Presence vs. Resolve

**Description:** Using your quick wit, intimidating presence, or even a strong display of magical power, you cause your enemies to doubt themselves. \newline

-   **Power Level 3** - Disadvantage 1
-   **Power Level 6** - Disadvantage 2
-   **Power Level 8** - Disadvantage 3

**Special:** Resisting this bane is a minor action.

## Disarmed

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 6
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Alteration, Energy, Entropy, Influence, Might, Movement
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Guard
-   Alteration vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Guard
-   Entropy vs. Toughness
-   Influence vs. Resolve
-   Might vs. Guard
-   Movement vs. Guard

**Description:** You force an opponent to lose control of an object they are holding, whether through brute force, mental compulsion, a skillful parry, heating the item to unbearable temperatures, shooting it from their hands, or some other means. \newline

**Effect:**

-   **Power Level 3** - The target drops an object they are holding in a space of your choosing within 15' of the target.

-   **Power Level 6** - As an alternative to moving the item, you can choose to assume control of it. If you do, you are now the wielder. For the wielder to regain control, they can react with a *disarmed* bane of their own to counter the effect or make an attribute roll (typically Might) with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + 2 x the attribute score you used to disarm the item.


## Dominated

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 hour)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** Though rare, domination is seen from time to time in legendary tales, often wielded by vampires, and sometimes by the most powerful of sorcerers or mad scientists who command legions of mindless zombies, completely enslaved to their will. \newline

**Effect:** The *dominated* bane manifests at two levels: lesser and greater.

**Lesser Domination** - The target obeys a one word command until the end of their next turn.

**Greater Domination** - The target's every action and move is under your control. Unlike the *charmed* bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, struggle to regain control of their own body. They cannot take actions of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. The attacker does not gain special access to the target's mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think or know that the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However, the order can be a series of verbal commands, such “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee.”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time, so giving a new command cancels all previous ones.

-   **Power Level 3** - You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, certain undead, etc.) with Lesser Domination.

-   **Power Level 5** - You can target creatures of human intelligence or better with Lesser Domination. You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, etc.) with Greater Domination.

-   **Power Level 9** - You can target creatures of human intelligence or greater with Greater Domination.

**Special:** While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.equent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

## Fatigued

**Duration:** Special
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5
\
**Attack Attributes:** Entropy
\
**Attack:**

-   Entropy vs. Toughness

**Description:** You cause the target's body to wither and weaken, gradually losing its ability to function until the victim finally succumbs to death. \newline

**Effect:** This bane has multiple tiers which are applied in succession. Each time this bane is inflicted, if it is already in effect on the target, the severity escalates by one level.

-   **Level 1** - The target has disadvantage 1 on all non-attack action rolls.

-   **Level 2** - The target is affected by the *slowed* bane, reducing its speed by half. This instance of the *slowed* bane cannot be resisted as normal. It persists until the fatigue is removed.

-   **Level 3** - The target has disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.

-   **Level 4** - The target loses their attribute bonuses to their defense scores (Agility and Might for Guard, Fortitude and Will for Toughness, Will and Presence for Resolve). They retain any armor, extraordinary, or feat bonuses.

-   **Level 5** - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances prevent the target from resting peacefully.

-   **Level 6** - The target dies.

**Special:** Unlike other banes, canceling this bane takes time and rest. Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion removes one level of fatigue. If the *restoration* boon is invoked, the character invoking it can remove one level of Fatigue (in addition to that removed by natural rest) if their attribute used to invoke restoration is between 1 and 6. A target cannot benefit from another invocation of the *restoration* boon until 24 hours have passed. If the *restoration* boon's invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one.


## Fear

**Duration:** Special
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5
\
**Attack Attributes:** Creation, Entropy, Influence, Might
\
**Attack:**

-   Creation vs. Resolve
-   Entropy vs. Resolve
-   Influence vs. Resolve
-   Might vs. Resolve

**Description:** Through an overwhelming force of physical might or extraordinary power, you strike terror into the hearts of enemies, causing them to flee from your presence. \newline

**Effect:** On its turn, the afflicted target must use its entire turn to get as far away as possible from you. It cannot use its actions to do anything other than retreat, and it cannot willingly move closer to you while the bane persists. \newline

**Special:** While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist them, this bane prevents the target from thinking clearly. However, the target's logical mind fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from this effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next hour.

## Forced Move

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 2, 4, 6, 8
\

\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Guard
-   Might vs. Guard
-   Movement vs. Guard

**Description:** With a forceful blow, magical gust of wind, or telekinetic push, you move your target against its will. \newline

**Effect:**  The target is moved a distance against their will, as determined by the bane's power level. The ending location is chosen by the attacker.

-   **Power Level 4** - The target is moved 10'.

-   **Power Level 6** - The target is moved 15'.

-   **Power Level 8** - The target is moved 20'.

## Immobile

**Duration:** Resist ends (special) (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action

-   Creation vs. Toughness
-   Energy vs. Toughness
-   Entropy vs. Toughness
-   Influence vs. Resolve
-   Might vs. Guard
-   Movement vs. Guard

**Description:** Whether through grappling, a precise nerve strike, entangling vines, mental compulsion, or a bone-numbing blast of cold, you render your foe incapable of movement. \newline

**Effect:** Your target cannot move from its current space. If you invoked the bane with a Might roll and are within 5' of the target, then both you and the target are immobile in your current space for the duration of the bane (locked in a grapple). While grappling in this manner, you can attempt to inflict this bane again upon the target. If successful, you can move your speed and take the target with you. If this attack fails, you can only move by first releasing the target and ending the bane.

If you invoked the bane with any attribute other than Might, you can move freely while the target remains affected.

You can choose to release the target as a free action, immediately ending the bane. \newline

**Special:** When an affected target succeeds at a resist roll to end this effect, they can move 15' as a free action.

## Incapacitated

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5, 7, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Entropy, Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Toughness
-   Entropy vs. Toughness
-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** Incapacitation is a catch-all bane for a variety of effects, including total paralysis, sleep, petrification, poison, being knocked out, fainting, or similar conditions that render a character completely helpless. \newline

**Effect:** The target is immobile (can't move from their current space) and unconscious. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls and are incapable of moving. As a result of being completely incapable of movement, an incapacitated character can be the victim of a finishing blow.

-   **Power Level 5** - The effect can be broken by a moderate disruption, such as a firm shove, a kick, glass of water, loud bang, etc.

-   **Power Level 7** - The effect can only be broken if the target takes 1 point of damage or more.

-   **Power Level 9** - The effect cannot be disrupted by external forces. Only the afflicted character's successful resist roll can end the effect.


**Special:** While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's body fights to regain consciousness. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next hour.


## Knockdown

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Energy, Might, Movement
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Guard
-   Might vs. Guard
-   Movement vs. Guard

**Description:** Whether via a thunderous blow from a great axe, an earth shattering bolt of supernatural energy, or a well aimed shove in a direction where the enemy's balance is weak, you knock the target off their feet. \newline

**Effect:** The target falls prone. Prone targets have disadvantage 1 on all attacks they make. Melee and area attacks against prone characters gain advantage 1. Projectile attacks against prone targets suffer disadvantage 1. Standing up from prone requires a move action and costs a character half (round down) of their speed for the round.

## Memory Alteration

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6, 8
\
**Attack Attributes:** Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** Warping or controlling the mind is one of the most dreaded powers of enchanters, causing powerful heroes to forget their homes, families, and quests. \newline

**Effect:** You alter the target's memories to an extent based on the power level of the bane.

-   **Power Level 5** - You temporarily modify a minor aspect of the target's memory. The target automatically regains the lost memory and realizes their confusion 1 hour later.

-   **Power Level 6** - You permanently erase or alter the last 5 minutes of the target's memory. The target does not know what happened during this time outside of the memories you feed them (including having seen you, if they did). Multiple uses of this bane progressively erase consecutive 5 minute increments.

-   **Power Level 8** - Instead of the immediate past, you can erase or alter memories from any time.

The memory alteration bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane.

This bane confers no special ability to know about a target's memory. The invoker must be aware of the memory either from rumor, personal knowledge, prescience, or other means. \newline

**Special:** When you target an enemy with this bane and your action roll fails to beat the target's Resolve defense, the target is immune to further invocations of this bane from you for the next 24 hours.

## Mind Dredge

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 2, 4, 6, 8, 9

-   **Power Level 4** - This power may target creatures of any intelligence. You gain access to the target's current thoughts.

-   **Power Level 6** - This power may target creatures of any intelligence. You gain access to the target's current thoughts as well as its recent memories. Initially, you may probe 1 day into the past. For every round that the bane persists, you gain access to an additional day's worth of memories.

-   **Power Level 8** - This power may target creatures of any intelligence. You gain access to the target's current thoughts as well as its distant memories. Initially, you may probe 1 year into the past. For every round that the bane persists, you gain access to an additional year's worth of memories. Alternatively, you may choose to access the memories associated with a particular place, object, or event.

-   **Power Level 9** - This power may target creatures of any intelligence. You gain access to the target's current thoughts as well as all of its memories, without limitation by time. Alternatively, you may choose to access the memories associated with a particular place, object, or event.


**Special:** When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.


## Nullify

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Protection
\
**Attack:**

-   Protection vs. Resolve

**Description:** Through magical power, technological hacking, or similar means, you are able to nullify your enemy's boons. \newline

**Effect:** You cancel a single boon currently in effect if it is of this bane's power level or lower. The invoking power level further impacts the effect as follows:

- **Power Level 1** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 1. You can cancel a boon that must be actively invoked. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.
- **Power Level 2** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 2
- **Power Level 3** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 3
- **Power Level 4** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 4
- **Power Level 5** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 5
- **Power Level 6** - Cancel a boon of Power Level 6. You can cancel a boon that is permanent, passive, or inherent to the target (e.g. the invisibility of a Will o' Wisp). Effects that would prevent *nullify* from being invoked in this way have no effect. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.
- **Power Level 7** -  Cancel a boon of Power Level 7
- **Power Level 8** -  Cancel a boon of Power Level 8
- **Power Level 9** -  Cancel a boon of Power Level 9

**Special:** If the targeted boon covers a large area, you can cancel all of it by targeting any portion of the effect you can see, or multi-targeting a number of 5' cubes you believe it to be in. If the targeted boon is affecting an area rather than a creature, you roll against the CR of the boon instead of a Resolve defense. The CR is 10 + 2 x the boons invoked power level.

## Persistent Damage

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Energy, Entropy
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Guard
-   Entropy vs. Toughness

**Description:** Whether by setting the target ablaze, covering them in acid, slicing an artery, or cursing them with a wasting disease, you inflict your foe with a lasting and recurring source of damage. \newline

**Effect:** At the beginning of the target's turn, before they take any actions, they suffer damage determined by the power level of the bane. This damage automatically bypasses the afflicted character's defenses but it can be reduced by any resistance to damage of a certain type (see the *resistance* boon). Like all dice rolls, these dice explode.

-   **Power Level 2** - 1d4 damage per round.
-   **Power Level 4** - 1d6 damage per round.
-   **Power Level 6** - 1d8 damage per round.
-   **Power Level 8** - 1d10 damage per round.
-   **Power Level 9** - 2d6 damage per round.

**Special:** Persistent damage comes in a number of different variations: physical damage (bleeding from a vital strike), energy damage (lightning, fire, cold, acid, etc.) and entropic damage (necromantic energy), among others. Each variation has its own cure. When that cure is applied with a major action (either by the afflicted character or another), the target receives a resist roll (as a free action) with advantage 1 to end the effect. The GM has the final word on whether a proposed cure can help a given type of persistent damage, but the  following examples can help with arbitration:

-   Bleeding damage is cured with a successful roll using Learning, Logic, or Creation.
-   Lightning damage is cured by a discharge or grounding of the current.
-   Cold damage is countered with warmth, heat, or fire.
-   Acid damage is neutralized with alkalizing agents (powder, milk, etc.).
-   Fire damage is neutralized with water or smothering.
-   Entropic damage is neutralized with extraordinary or magical healing.


## Phantasm

**Duration:** Special
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** You create an illusory manifestation to deceive the senses. \newline

**Effect:** You create a phantasm of your choosing. The power level at which you invoke the bane determines which senses you can deceive as well as the maximum size of your illusion, as follows:

-   **Power Level 1** - Affect Taste. Manifest a 5' x 5' x 5' area phantasm
-   **Power Level 2** - Affect Smell, Sound, or Touch
-   **Power Level 3** - Affect Sight
-   **Power Level 4** -  Manifest a 10' x 10' x 10' area phantasm
-   **Power Level 5** - Manifest a 15' x 15' x 15' area phantasm
-   **Power Level 6** - Affect All Senses
-   **Power Level 7** - Manifest a 15' x 15' x 15' area phantasm
-   **Power Level 8** - Manifest a 20' x 20' x 20' area phantasm
-   **Power Level 9** - Manifest a 40' x 40' x 40' area phantasm

Until reaching power level 6, you can combine sensory illusions by adding the required power levels together (e.g., mimicking both sight and sound requires power level 5). While the phantasm persists, you can make logical changes to it freely. For example, an illusory person can speak naturally as you direct it and could be made to fall in response to an attack. However, substantial changes to the illusion (such as transforming a human into a goblin) require a new invocation of the illusion. \newline

**Special:** Unlike other banes, this bane does not work by targeting specific enemies. Instead, your Influence roll for invoking it is compared with the Resolve defense of each character that would perceive the created effect if it were real. If the roll is lower than their Resolve, they perceive none of the phantasm's effects. If the roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve, they perceive the illusory effect you create and react as if it were real.

When mimicking a very specific person, place, or thing that the target is very familiar with, the GM should consider increasing the target's Resolve defense for the purpose of that particular phantasm invocation.

Characters convinced by the phantasm can roll Resist as normal in order to attempt to shake off the bane. If successful, they are no longer deceived by the effect. In addition, you must spend a minor action to sustain the bane during each of your turns. Failing to do so in a given round causes the bane's effects to cease at the end of your turn.

When an affected character succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent phantasms invoked by you for the next hour. \newline

## Polymorph

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 hour)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6, 8, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Alteration
\
**Attack:**

-   Alteration vs. Toughness

**Description:** You alter the size, shape, and composition of the target by causing them to grow, shrink, or assume a completely new form, like that of a sheep or a newt. \newline

**Effect:** Your power level determines the extent to which you can transform your target, as follows. If the target is transformed into a different creature, it uses the Might, Agility, Fortitude, and Perception attribute scores of the new creature.

-   **Power Level 5** - Polymorph a creature into another creature of the same size. This new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 2. If the new form would have higher attributes, the target becomes an exceptional version of that creature. For example, transforming a deadly sniper with Agility 5 into a clumsy ogre with Agility 0, would leave the target with an Agility of 3 instead of the 0 typical for the new form.

-   **Power Level 6** - Polymorph a creature into another creature between double and half the size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 3.

-   **Power Level 8** - Polymorph a creature into another creature between quadruple and one-quarter its original size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 5.

-   **Power Level 9** - Polymorph a creature into another creature of any size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 7.

In order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Agent Walker has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a sheep and has her Fortitude reduced by 2, leaving her at 16 hit points. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total becomes 1 instead. \newline

If the same target is affected by this bane from multiple sources, as long as their attack includes one of those who targeted them, they are not affected by the penalty. Unlike other banes, your damaging attack against one target can trigger this bane in a different target, provided your roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve defense (that is, by striking one foe, you can provoke another).

-   **Power Level 4** - The target suffers disadvantage 1 on attacks that do not include you.

-   **Power Level 5** - The target suffers disadvantage 2 on attacks that do not include you.

-   **Power Level 6** - The target suffers disadvantage 3 on attacks that do not include you.

-   **Power Level 7** - The target suffers disadvantage 4 on attacks that do not include you.

-   **Power Level 8** - The target suffers disadvantage 5 on attacks that do not include you.

-   **Power Level 9** - The target suffers disadvantage 6 on attacks that do not include you.

## spying

**Duration:** 10 minutes (special)
\
**Invocation Time:** 10 Minutes
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6, 7, 9
\
**Attack Attributes:** Prescience
\
**Attack:**

-   Prescience vs. Resolve (special)

**Description:** Either through innate extrasensory perception or a special conduit such as a computer terminal, bubbling cauldron, or a crystal ball, you can view the target from a distance. \newline

**Effect:** You can spy on a person or area that you are familiar with. The power level of this bane determines the maximum distance between you and the target. If successfully invoked, you can see and hear everything that goes on within a 60' radius of your target. Anyone within the targeted area who has a Resolve defense score higher than your Prescience action roll to invoke this bane becomes aware of an unseen presence in the area (regardless of whether or not you succeed at the roll). Certain creatures may be able to identify your spying if they are familiar with such powers.

-   **Power Level 5** - 1 mile or less
-   **Power Level 6** - 100 miles or less
-   **Power Level 7** - More than 100 miles, but on the same dimension or plane of reality
-   **Power Level 9** - Any dimension or plane of reality. (Peering into certain dimensions may expose you to other dangers at the GM's discretion).

**Special:** When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make a Prescience roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated. However, you must retest your new roll against the Resolve scores of those in the targeted area to determine whether or not they can sense your presence.

You can attempt to spy the same target any number of times, but if your action roll fails, that target becomes immune to your spying for 24 hours.

## Sickened

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3
\
**Attack Attributes:** Entropy
\
**Attack:**

-   Entropy vs. Toughness

**Description:** Entropic energy overcomes the target, bombarding their system and inducing nausea that makes any kind of action difficult. \newline

**Effect:** The target suffers disadvantage 2 to all action rolls.

## Silenced

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 2
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Alteration, Entropy, Might
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Toughness
-   Alteration vs. Toughness
-   Entropy vs. Toughness
-   Might vs. Toughness

**Description:** Silence overcomes the target, whether from the warping of sound around the target, or from a physical effect like strangulation or suffocation.

**Effect:** If Might, Agility, or Entropy is used to inflict this bane, then the character is suffering strangulation and unable to speak. If the bane is inflicted using Alteration, then all sound within 5' of the target is suppressed through extraordinary means, making their footsteps and the usual clank of belongings they are carrying inaudible.

## Slowed

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Energy, Entropy, Might, Movement
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Guard
-   Energy vs. Guard
-   Entropy vs. Toughness
-   Might vs. Guard
-   Movement vs. Guard

**Description:** The target's movement is impaired, either by extreme cold, prolonged heat, poison, or injury to one or both legs. \newline

**Effect:** The afflicted target's speed is reduced to half its current speed, rounded down to the nearest 5' increment. This applies to all movement that is physical (flight, walking, climbing, etc.). If the target is currently under a magical effect that increases speed, the two effects are canceled for the duration that both affect the target.

## Stunned

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 4
\
**Attack Attributes:** Agility, Energy, Entropy, Might
\
**Attack:**

-   Agility vs. Toughness
-   Energy vs. Toughness
-   Entropy vs. Toughness
-   Might vs. Toughness

**Description:** You disorient the target's senses, causing them to act much less efficiently. \newline

**Effect:** During the target's turn, they are limited to either a single major action, a single move action, or a single minor action. Effects that grant additional actions do not circumvent this unless they grant a free action. Note that a target expending its move action to resist this bane will receive the remainder of their usual actions if the resist roll succeeds. \newline

**Special:** This bane has special rules for boss NPCs. A boss is only affected by the stunned bane during its normal initiative turn. It may still take all of its boss actions as usual.

## Stupefied

**Duration:** Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 7
\
**Attack Attributes:** Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** Being stupefied causes the target to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and pacifism. \newline

**Effect:** The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the target's Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the target has the approximate intelligence of a child. If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee. \newline

**Special:** While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional resist roll to break free from the bane. Also any action that would startle a wild animal (being hit with a rock, slapped on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target's typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

## Truthfulness

**Duration:** 10 minutes (special)
\
**Invocation Time:** 10 Minutes
\
**Power Level:** 5
\
**Attack Attributes:** Influence
\
**Attack:**

-   Influence vs. Resolve

**Description:** By controlling the target's mind through compulsion magic, chemical injection, neural probes, or similar means, you render them incapable of lying deliberately. \newline

**Effect:** The target answers any question asked with honesty, to the best of their knowledge. When compelled to reveal something they would not reveal outside of duress, the target makes a Will roll and you make an Influence roll. If the target's roll is higher than yours, then they resist the bane and the effect ends. \newline

**Special:** When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make another Influence roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated.

When a target wins the contested Will vs. Influence roll, you cannot target them with this bane again for 24 hours.













## Reading a Boon Description

Each boon description includes the following elements.

**Power Level.** This number indicates the required attribute score needed to invoke the boon. If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2, 4, 6), then the boon can be invoked at multiple tiers of power. The *Heal* boon, for example, heals more damage as you invoke it at higher power levels. The power level of a boon also determines the Challenge Rating of the attribute roll to invoke the boon. The CR equals 10 + 2 x Power Level.

**Attributes.** This is a list of the attribute or attributes that can be used to invoke the boon. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the Power Level, then you can invoke the boon.

**Invocation Time.** The required time that it takes to invoke the boon. Most boons have an invocation time of 1 major action. For boons that have a longer time, you must spend the entire invocation time concentrating on nothing other than invoking the boon. If you are interrupted, you must start the casting over.

**Duration.** Most boons have a duration of “sustain persists”, which indicates that the invoker must use a sustain action every round in order to keep the boon in effect. If you have a boon in effect and don't sustain it, the boon's effects cease at the end of your turn. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, which can only be taken once per turn, you can typically sustain only one boon at a time.

**Description.** This entry simply provides a general idea of what the boon could look like in the story.

**Effect.** This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the boon on the rules of the game.


## Boons List

Below is a complete list of boons available to any character that meets the Power Level prerequisite.


## Absorb Object

**Duration:** Permanent
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 4
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Movement \newline

**Description:** By restructuring your bodily composition, creating an extradimensional space, utilizing a cybernetic storage implant, or similar means, you absorb an object into your body, leaving it completely hidden from others and ready for access at a moment's notice. \newline

**Effect:** The object remains in place, completely hidden from the perception of others, until the target summons or recalls it (automatically) as a minor action. If anything happens to cancel this boon (such as the *nullify* bane), the object is immediately shunted out of the target's body as if the object had been withdrawn.

## Animation

**Duration:** Permanent
\
**Invocation Time:** 8 Hours
\
**Power Level:** 6, 8
\
**Attributes:** Creation, Entropy, Logic \newline

**Description:** You create a being of subhuman intelligence that persists indefinitely and autonomously. It might be a living creature, an undead fiend, a sentient construct, or any similar creation possessing lifelike properties. Examples of this boon in play include a necromancer creating an undead bodyguard, a mad scientist forging a subhuman being from body parts collected from a variety of corpses, and an engineer creating a cyborg from parts collected at a scrap yard. \newline

**Effect:** You are able to create an autonomous being from inanimate material components, such as dirt, bones, water, vines, scrap metal, or sand (the materials used are subject to the GM's discretion). To do so, you must first spend 8 hours completing a ritual, experiment, or similar manufacturing process. After this process is complete, make an action roll to invoke this boon. If successful, the inanimate form is permanently imbued with sentience.

Your ability to animate a creature does not grant you the permanent ability to control it. However, newly animated beings are affected by the *charmed* bane (see below), and thus treat you more favorably immediately following their creation.

The GM, not the player, is responsible for deciding the attributes and abilities of this animated creature and should follow the guidelines established by the "Simple Build" section for creating NPCs in Chapter 8: Running the Game. Creatures created using this boon are typically limited to those of subhuman intelligence, such as zombies, combat droids, and golems.

-   **Power Level 6** - You can animate a single creature. Your invoking attribute score must be equal to or greater than the highest attribute score of the creature you're animating. With a successful invocation, the creature comes into existence with the charmed (Minor Charm) bane already in effect (no roll is required).
-   **Power Level 8** - You may choose to animate a group of creatures: Either 10 creatures with a max attribute of 2, 5 creatures with a max attribute of 3, or 2 creatures with a max attribute of 5. In addition, the automatically invoked *charmed* bane is a Major Charm instead of Minor Charm.

## Aura

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 4, 6, 8
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Creation, Energy, Entropy, Influence, Movement, Presence, Presience, Protection \newline

**Description:** You surround a willing target in an aura that hurts their foes or helps their allies. \newline

**Effect:** An aura extends from a willing target to a distance determined by the power level of this boon:

-    **Power Level 4:** 5' radius
-    **Power Level 6:** 10' radius
-    **Power Level 8:** 15' radius

Choose a single bane or boon which uses the same attribute that you used to invoke Aura. The maximum power level for the chosen bane or boon is one-half the power level of your aura. Your aura radiates the chosen bane or boon as follows:

-   **If the aura radiates a bane,** then the target of the aura is not affected by it. All other creatures (friend or foe) who willingly enter the area of the aura or end their turn within it suffer a bane attack to inflict the chosen bane. No creature may be subject to a bane attack from the same creature's aura more than once per round.

-   **If the aura radiates a boon,** then the target of the aura is also affected by it. The target and all allies who end their turn within the area of the aura automatically gain the chosen boon. Upon leaving the area of the aura, the boon is immediately removed. No creature may gain a boon from the same creature's aura more than once per round.

**Special:** This boon may require special attention and adjudication from the GM, as not all banes and boons may be an appropriate fit for an aura. Telekinesis, for example, is not a boon that can be granted to allies and thus does not work well as an aura.

## Barrier

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 7, 9
\
**Attributes:** Creation, Energy, Entropy, Protection \newline

**Description:** You summon forth a wall of thorns, ring of fire, swarm of robotic pests, cloud of entropic fog, or similar barrier to hurt or hinder your foes.

**Effect:** When you invoke this boon, you must use multi-targeting to create a specific area of effect to define the space of your barrier. Upon successful invocation, choose a number of available properties for your wall based on your power level:

-   **Power Level 3** - Choose 1 property: Damaging (1d4), Obscuring, Hindering
-   **Power Level 5** - Choose 2 properties: Damaging (1d8), Obscuring, Hindering, Baneful, Mobile
-   **Power Level 7** - Choose 3 properties: Damaging (1d10), Obscuring, Hindering, Baneful, Mobile, Impassable
-   **Power Level 9** - Choose 4 properties: Damaging (2d6), Obscuring, Hindering, Baneful, Mobile, Impassable

**Damaging:** A creature who ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, automatically suffers the indicated damage. A creature may only suffer this damage once per round.
**Obscuring:** Creatures cannot see through more than 10' of the barrier.
**Hindering:** Creatures move at half speed when travelling within the barrier.
**Impassable:** Creatures and objects cannot move through the barrier. If you place an impassable barrier in a space occupied by a creature, move that creature to the closest position of their choice that is not inside of the barrier. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
**Baneful:** Choose a bane which you can inflict that has a power level less than or equal to the power level of your barrier. When a creature ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, you may immediately make a bane attack against it to inflict the chosen bane. A creature can only be subject to one such bane attack from this barrier per round.
**Mobile:** You may spend a major action to move the barrier up to 30 feet.

## Blindsight

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Entropy, Perception, Prescience \newline

**Description:** Even in the absence of light you are able to distinguish your surroundings. \newline

**Effect:** The target is immune to the blinded *bane* and they are able to see normally even in conditions of little or no light. Blindsight can also potentially counter invisiblity, though the GM will have to decide if the source creating the blindsight is appropriate to counter the source creating the *invisible* boon.

## Bolster

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 6, 8
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Creation, Prescience, Presence \newline

**Description:** You bolster your target's chances of success via inspiration, augmentation, divine blessing, or supernatural insight. Your target becomes more competent than they normally are. \newline

**Effect:** Choose a single attribute. The target gains advantage on their action rolls with that attribute according to the Power Level of the boon.

-   **Power Level 3** - Advantage 1
-   **Power Level 6** - Advantage 2
-   **Power Level 8** - Advantage 3

## Darkness

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Entropy, Influence \newline

**Description:** You create an area of illusory darkness or entropic energy that snuffs out all light. \newline

**Effect:** Choose a space or object within range. Darkness emanates from the target to a radius equal to five feet per power level of the boon. The effect cancels the effect of all natural light within its radius of effect and creatures that depend on light for vision suffer as though they have the *blinded* bane while in the area of effect. Creatures that do not depend on light for their vision (if they have tremorsense, blindsight, etc.) are unaffected. If the darkness area overlaps an area affected by the *light* boon, then the one of greater power level supersedes the other. If the power level of both is equal, then they cancel each other out.

## Detection

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1
\
**Attributes:** Prescience \newline

**Description:** You gain extraordinary vision that allows you to see colored auras which correlate to magical, spiritual, or other extraordinary forces. \newline

**Effect:** When calling on this boon, you must choose the type of aura you are detecting: **holy**, **unholy**, **life**, **death**, and **magic**. You can perceive invisible auras pertaining to the chosen type of force and have an approximate sense of their strength (from weak to overwhelming). These auras are usually based on an action that is deliberate, so an otherwise kind shopkeeper would radiate an aura of death for a time after poisoning or killing someone. Even a paladin slaying an evil archmage will give off a radius of death for a time after the killing blow.

-   **Holy** - Holy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the heavens or similar good-aligned dimensions where pure goodness is embodied.

-   **Unholy** - Unholy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the hells or similar evil-aligned dimensions where pure evil is embodied.

-   **Life** - Beings from heavenly dimensions, far-future regenerative nanotech, and clerics wielding the power of healing or protection radiate an aura of life for a time after wielding such capabilities.

-   **Death** - Necromancers, undead, and murderers all radiate an aura of death. For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death and magic is what animates them.

-   **Magic** - Extraordinary auras surround objects or places imbued with such effects. Extraordinary creatures who are innately magical, such as a nymph, constantly radiate magic. Natural creatures who wield magic, such as a human wizard, give off an aura only following use of their power.

**Special:** Unlike other boons, this boon cannot target another character. Only the character invoking the boon can see the auras. Additionally, the GM may allow other types of suitable auras to be detected as appropriate to the campaign setting.

## Flight

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6, 8
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Movement \newline

**Description:** The target takes to the skies. \newline

**Effect:**

-   **Power Level 5** - The target gains a flight speed of 10'.

-   **Power Level 6** - The target gains a flight speed of 30'.

**Effect:**
-   **Power Level 1** - You can create *temporary* non-sentient matter (plants, dirt, water, vines, etc.), anything created in this way deteriorates or decomposes to become useless after 1 hour. Using this boon you can create 1 cubic foot of nonliving matter per attribute point of the invoking attribute. The invocation time for this application is 10 minutes.

-   **Power Level 3** - You can create *permanent* non-sentient matter (plants, dirt, water, vines, etc.). Using this boon you can either create enough food for 1 person or 1 cubic foot of nonliving matter per attribute point of the invoking attribute. The invocation time for this application is 1 hour.

-   **Power Level 5** - The quantity of *permanent* non-sentient matter (plants, dirt, water, vines, etc.). you can create expands, you can now produce 5 cubic feet per attribute point of the invoking attribute.

-   **Power Level 7** - You can create *permanent* mundane and organically complex or dense non-sentient matter, such as gems, iron, or marble. The resulting object's value can't be greater than a Wealth Level 2 item. You produce 1 cubic foot of such matter per attribute point of the invoking attribute. The invocation time for this application is 8 hours.

-   **Power Level 9** - You can create not just raw materials, but **permanent** crafted items - though a craftsman is still required to work anything into an exceptional quality. The invocation time for this application is 8 hours.

-   **Power Level 6** - The target's speed is increased by 20', and it gains +2 to Guard. Additionally, the target can make one extra major action on each of its turns. This action cannot be used to perform an interrupt action. If the action requires a roll, it suffers disadvantage 3.

-   **Power Level 8** - The target's speed is increased by 30', and it gains +3 to Guard. Additionally, the target can make up to two extra major actions on each of its turns. These actions cannot be used to perform an interrupt action. If the target takes 1 extra action that action has disadvantage 3, if they take a 2nd extra action, that action has disadvantage 6.

## Heal

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Creation, Learning, Logic, Presence \newline

**Description:** Healing can be one of two things: the actual mending of wounds and broken bones through sources like medicine, surgery, or supernatural creative life force, or the inspiration of your target to carry on fighting, even in the face of death. \newline

**Effect:** Roll dice according to the boon power level below. These dice explode as normal. The target is healed a number of hit points equal to the total roll.

\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 7
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Entropy \newline

**Description:** When a creature becomes insubstantial, it is no longer bound by physical barriers. \newline

**Effect:** The target gains the ability to pass freely through all physical barriers as if they were unoccupied spaces. In addition, they gain the ability to freely move in any direction in both the horizontal and vertical planes at their base speed (30' for most characters). While insubstantial, the target becomes immune to all attacks that target either Guard or Toughness. However, they also cannot deliver any attacks that target Guard or Toughness.

If concentration is interrupted or the boon ends while the target is inside of a solid structure, then the target is forcibly transported to the alternate plane they were traveling by way of at the time (typically the Astral or Ethereal plane).

## Invisible

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Influence \newline

**Description:** The target vanishes from the visible spectrum, either by bending light, creating an illusion, or stepping into an extradimensional space between the fabric of the planes.  \newline

**Effect:** Light passes through the target, making them translucent, however their physical form distorts and refracts light in a way that only the keenest sight can perceive. The target gains advantage according to the boon's Power Level on Agility rolls to hide. If completely still, this bonus is doubled. The target's Guard defense is increased against melee and ranged attacks, though it is unchanged against area attacks. When making an attack against target's that can't see you, their Guard defense is reduced. You cannot be the target of opportunity attacks unless the enemy can see you through non-visual means.

-   **Power Level 5** - Advantage 3 to hide, +3 to Guard against ranged and melee attacks, and -2 to Guard for targets that can't see you.

-   **Power Level 6** - Advantage 5 to hide, +5 to Guard against ranged and melee attacks, and -4 to Guard for targets that can't see you.

## Life Drain

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5
\
**Attributes:** Entropy \newline

**Description:** This boon allows the target to steal the very lifeforce of their foes. \newline

**Effect:** While this boon persists, the target heals half (round up) of the damage they inflict with each attack. If an attack damages multiple foes, the target of this boon heals based on the total damage inflicted against all foes.

## Light

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Minor Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Creation, Energy \newline

**Description:** You illuminate an area with a bright light. \newline

**Effect:** Choose a space or object within range. Extraordinary light emanates from the target to a radius equal five feet per power level of the boon. If the light area overlaps an area affected by the *darkness* boon, then the one of greater power level supersedes the other. If the power level of both is equal, then they cancel each other out.

## Precognition

**Duration:** 1 round
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Minute
\
**Power Level:** 1, 3, 5, 7
\
**Attributes:** Prescience \newline

**Effect:**
-   **Power Level 1** - The target asks a question about a course of action they plan to take within the next five minutes. The GM communicates the insight through vague symbols, impressions, or a single word such as “favorable” or “unfavorable”.

-   **Power Level 3** - The target asks a question about a course of action they plan to take within the next hour. The GM communicates the insight through vague symbols, impressions, or a single word such as “favorable” or “unfavorable”.

-   **Power Level 5** - The target asks a single question about a particular event, decision, person, place, etc. The GM provides a meaningful (not vague, but still brief) explanation in one or two sentences that is a direct response to the knowledge the target seeks. Only one question can be asked about a given subject each week.

-   **Power Level 7** - The target can choose a particular event, decision, person, place, etc. After invoking this boon, the target begins to have extraordinary encounters (visions, trances, dreams, out-of-body experiences, etc.) through which the GM will provide the target with detailed information about the subject of your prescience. You can only maintain one such subject at a given time, however concentration is not required to maintain this state, it is perpetuated until you either choose to end it, or you choose to shift your focus.

## Reading

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Prescience \newline

**Description:** You reach out and connect with an object or place, gaining the ability to read residual information from it and divine what has occurred in its vicinity in the past. \newline

**Effect:** When you successfully invoke this boon, you gain information from an
object or place within range as follows:

-   **Power Level 5** - The target can read vague ideas and impressions to learn what took place near the object or place within the past hour.

-   **Power Level 6** - The target can read vague ideas and impressions to learn what took place near the object or place within the past hour.

-   **Power Level 7** - The target can ascertain the most recent owner of the object or the people who have most recently been in a place. This knowledge grants enough information for your target to use the *spying* bane to locate or view those identified.

-   **Power Level 8** - Choose one: The target sees a vision of the most recent significant event that took place in close proximity to the object or place - OR - the target asks whether or not a specific event is impressed upon the object or place.

-   **Power Level 9** - The target is able, given sufficient time, to access all memories impressed upon the object or place. You must maintain concentration, with each 10 minutes yielding a new vision from the object's or place's past. The GM determines the order in which the information is revealed. At the GM's discretion, concealed or particularly distant memories may require a much longer time to discover.

## Regeneration

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Creation \newline

**Description:** The target gains an extraordinary ability to heal their wounds. \newline

**Effect:** While the *regeneration* boon is sustained, the target heals hit points at the beginning of each of the *boon invoker's* turns. The amount of healing is determined by the power level of the boon.

-   **Power Level 1** - 1d4
-   **Power Level 3** - 1d6
-   **Power Level 5** - 1d8
-   **Power Level 7** - 1d10
-   **Power Level 9** - 2d6

**Special:** This boon does not heal lethal damage.

## Resistance

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 7, 9
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Energy, Movement, Protection \newline

**Description:** The target becomes resistant to the effects of damage from a certain type of attack. \newline

**Effect:** When the boon is invoked, the invoker chooses one type of attack and the target gains resistance to that type. The types include precise, forceful, fire, cold, lightning, acid, influence, and entropy (other types may be approved by the GM). The effect of the resistance is determined by the power level of the boon (the following are not cumulative):

-   **Power Level 3** - The target's defense scores are increased by 3 against the chosen attack type.

-   **Power Level 5** - The target's defense scores are increased by 6 against the chosen attack type.

-   **Power Level 7** - The target's defense scores are increased by 9 against the chosen attack type.

-   **Power Level 9** - The target is immune to damage and harmful effects from the chosen attack type.

## Restoration

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Creation, Protection \newline

**Description:** You cancel all harmful afflictions that are affecting your target. \newline

**Effect:** You can dispel all banes affecting your target of a power level less than or equal to the level at which you invoke this boon.

-   **Power Level 1** - Cancel banes of Power Level 1 or less.
-   **Power Level 2** - Cancel banes of Power Level 2 or less.
-   **Power Level 3** - Cancel banes of Power Level 3 or less.
-   **Power Level 4** - Cancel banes of Power Level 4 or less.
-   **Power Level 5** - Cancel banes of Power Level 5 or less.
-   **Power Level 6** - Cancel banes of Power Level 6 or less.
-   **Power Level 7** - Cancel banes of Power Level 7 or less.
-   **Power Level 8** - Cancel banes of Power Level 8 or less.
-   **Power Level 9** - Cancel banes of Power Level 9 or less.

**Special:** You can dispel banes of a power level beyond your power level of this boon. In order to do so, you must invoke this boon using an action roll (i.e., it is not compatible with the automatic success granted by the *boon focus* feat). The Challenge Rating to dispel a bane in this manner is equal to 20 + twice the bane's power level. So, for example, a power level 9 bane can be dispelled on a roll of 38 even if the invoker does not have an attribute score of 9.

## Seeing

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 4, 5, 6
\
**Attributes:** Prescience \newline

**Description:** You are able to see through the eyes of a willing ally. \newline

**Effect:** For as long as you concentrate, you can see through the eyes of the target, a willing ally. The target can be any friendly creature, including animals, beasts, and humanoids. The distance of the connection depends on the power level of this boon.

-   **Power Level 4** - The ally must be within 100'.
-   **Power Level 5** - The ally must be within 1 mile.
-   **Power Level 6** - The ally must be anywhere on the same plane of existence.

**Special:** If your action roll to invoke this boon fails, that ally cannot be targeted for 1 hour.

## Shapeshift

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
\
**Attributes:** Alteration \newline

**Description:** A target's physical structure is temporarily altered, allowing it to assume the form of potentially any creature no matter how fantastic or exotic.  \newline

**Effect:** You or a willing creature you touch transform into a creature whose highest attribute is less than or equal to your Alteration score. Your Alteration score for the purpose of this boon is limited to the maximum attribute score permitted by your level. With the exception of Alteration, all of the target's extraordinary attribute scores drop to zero, and they acquire the Agility, Fortitude, Might, and Perception attributes of the new form.

The GM, not the player, is responsible for deciding the attributes and abilities of creature. It is recommended that this creature follow the guidelines established by the "Simple Build" section for creating NPCs.

In order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Vera has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a dragon and her Fortitude increases from 5 to 9, increasing her hit points to 28. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into her human form, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total becomes 1 instead.

Limitations are applied starting at power level 2 and are gradually removed at higher power levels:

-   **Power Level 2** - The new form cannot be a different size than that of the target. It must possess similar physiology to the target, so humanoids and animals are both mammals and therefore can be shifted between. However animals, dragons, plants, elementals, and oozes all have different physiologies, so they cannot be shifted between. The target does not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming, climbing, burrowing, etc.). The target does not gain extraordinary attributes of the new form (hence, they cannot inflict banes that rely on the creature's extraordinary attributes).
-   **Power Level 3** - Shapeshift into a creature between half and double the target's original size. Gain any non-flight movement modes of the new form.
-   **Power Level 4** - Shapeshift into a creature between one quarter and quadruple the target's original size.
-   **Power Level 5** - Gain the flying movement mode of the new form, if applicable.
-   **Power Level 6** - Shapeshift into a living creature of a different physiology, such as an elemental, ooze, or a plant.
-   **Power Level 7** - Gain all extraordinary attributes possessed by the target. If both forms have an Alteration attribute, the target chooses between the two scores.
-   **Power Level 8** - Shapeshift into a creature of any size.

**Special:** Shapeshifting into a specific creature (attempting to impersonate them) requires a Deception action roll which is opposed by Perception attribute of anyone who sees the shapeshifted creature. In addition, at power levels 4 and lower, the target does not gain mastery over any special movement modes granted by the new form. As such, the movement speed is cut in half for movement modes not native to the original form, and the GM may rule that certain actions, such as swimming in combat, suffer disadvantage on relevant action rolls.

## Summon Creature

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Focus Action
\
**Power Level:** 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Alteration, Creation, Entropy, Energy \newline

**Description:** You summon forth a creature to assist your cause.

**Effect:** You create or summon a temporary NPC companion that is under your control, though of limited intelligence. Your minion's statistics are determined by the power level of this boon. You may assign the attributes as you see fit among the following: Agility, Fortitude, Might, Perception, Energy, and Entropy. Your minion's attributes do not affect their hit points or defenses.

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.25}OCT{.25}OCT{.25}OCT{.25}}

| Power Level | Hit Points | Defenses | Attributes |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| 4 | 4 | 11 | 2, 1, 1 |
| 5 | 5 | 12 | 3, 2, 2 |
| 6 | 6 | 13 | 4, 3, 3 |
| 7 | 7 | 14 | 5, 4, 4 |
| 8 | 8 | 15 | 6, 5, 5 |
| 9 | 9 | 16 | 7, 6, 6 |

Your minion cannot act on the turn that it is summoned. On each of your following turns, your minion acts on your initiative count according to your direction, receiving the usual assortment of actions. You are limited to a maximum number of summoned creatures equal to your invoking attribute score. Feats and other abilities cannot increase this limit.

**Special:** Creatures summoned by this boon cannot be healed if they reach zero hit points. They are permanently dead. Additionally, creatures summoned by this boon cannot invoke it.

Multi-targeting for this boon does not work as it does for other boons. You may use a single invocation to summon multiple creatures. For each additional creature summoned beyond the first, you suffer an additional disadvantage 2 on your action roll to invoke. Any effect that modifies multi-targeting penalties will work as normal in offsetting this disadvantage.

## Telekinesis

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 7, 9
\
**Attributes:** Movement \newline

**Description:** You reach out and extraordinarily control an unattended inanimate object. \newline

**Effect:** Immediately upon invoking the boon, and again each round when you sustain the boon, you may move the target object up to 30'. As part of moving an object, you may also manipulate it (for example, turning a door knob or opening a coin purse). A new invocation of this boon must be attempted whenever you wish to target a different object. The power level of the boon determines the size and weight of the objects you may target:

-   **Power Level 3** - The object must be smaller than a 1' cube or lighter than 10 pounds.
-   **Power Level 5** - The object must be smaller than a 5' cube or lighter than 100 pounds.
-   **Power Level 7** - The object must be smaller than a 10' cube or lighter than 1,000 pounds.
-   **Power Level 9** - The object must be smaller than a 20' cube or lighter than 10,000 pounds.

## Telepathy

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Major Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 6, 7
\
**Attributes:** Influence, Prescience \newline

**Description:** You reach out mentally to a willing target and speak wordlessly with thought-to-thought communication. \newline

**Effect:** You and the target can communicate with each other simply through thought. Note that this telepathy does not bestow intelligence upon creatures, so you could not use it to communicate with a squirrel unless you already possessed other means of doing so. Additionally, telepathy does not bypass language barriers, so you would need to already speak the language of your target.

-   **Power Level 3** - You can communicate telepathically with a single creature of animal-level intelligence or lower. Keep in mind that it can only communicate concepts with you that it can understand.

-   **Power Level 5** - You can communicate telepathically with a single creature of humanoid intelligence.

-   **Power Level 6** - You can create a mental relay between yourself and up to five other creatures allowing each of them to communicate with the rest of the group simultaneously.

-   **Power Level 7** - You can communicate telepathically with any number of creatures that you can see.

## Teleport

**Duration:** Instantaneous
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Move Action
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 7, 9
\
**Attributes:** Movement \newline

**Description:** You are able to instantly move yourself or an ally from one place to another. \newline

**Effect:**
-   **Power Level 3** - You can teleport the target to any unoccupied space within 5 feet per Movement attribute score as long as you can naturally see your destination.

-   **Power Level 5** - Your teleportation range is unchanged, but you can now teleport your target to spaces that you can't see. If you choose an occupied space, your target lands in the nearest adjacent space (roll randomly to decide if there are multiple options) and your target is stunned for 1 round (a resist roll is not needed to end the effect).

-   **Power Level 7** - You can opt to take longer in invoking the boon. If you choose to do so, for each minute of invocation (delay before making your action roll) you can teleport the target 1 mile, up to a maximum number of miles equal to your Movement attribute score. While the distance is greater, this mode is also dangerous, as a misunderstanding of direction or geography can put your target many miles in an unfavorable direction. You simply choose a direction (relative to your starting location) and teleport your target a number of miles equal to your Movement score. During invocation, you must spend a focus action each turn until the invocation time passes.

-   **Power Level 9** - Using the same longer invocation time for power level 7, you can now teleport your target to any location without range limit, provided you have personally seen (through magical or normal means) the destination.

## Tongues

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 10 Minutes
\
**Power Level:** 5, 6
\
**Attributes:** Prescience \newline

**Description:** You or an ally temporarily gains the ability to read, write, and speak languages that they are otherwise unfamiliar with. \newline

**Effect:**

## Transmutation

**Duration:** Sustain Persists
\
**Invocation Time:** 1 Minute
\
**Power Level:** 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Alteration \newline

**Description:** You are able to change the size, shape, and composition of physical matter that you touch. \newline

**Effect:** Your power level determines the types of matter you can transmute as well as the duration of the effect. The duration is either *temporary* or *permanent*. A **temporary** transmutation must be sustained every round. A **permanent** transmutation does not have to be sustained and persists until some other effect would cancel it. The maximum volume of matter you can transmute is on 5 cubic feet multiplied by your attribute score.

-   **Power Level 3** - *Temporarily* transmute an object into another object of the same size and weight.

-   **Power Level 5** - *Temporarily* transmute an object into another object of the same size and 50% greater or lesser weight. *Temporarily* transmute an object into another object of the same weight and 50% greater or lesser size.

\
**Power Level:** 5, 7, 8, 9
\
**Attributes:** Prescience \newline

**Description:** You grant yourself or an ally the ability to extraordinarily perceive things through impediments that would block or deceive normal sight, including darkness, solid objects, illusions, and even the barrier between alternate planes of reality. \newline

**Effect:**

-   **Power Level 5** - The target sees the presence of extraordinary effects such as magic, cloaking technology, and other effects that could be seen through extra-visual perception. In addition, this boon grants advantage 1 on rolls used to detect mundane concealment such as hidden passages, furniture with hidden storage, and concealed traps or other hazards.

-   **Power Level 7** - The target's extraordinary sight pierces through all illusory effects, allowing them to see an illusion for what it is.

-   **Power Level 8** - The target can see through solid objects and their natural visual range is unhindered by them.

-   **Power Level 9** - The extraordinary sight enables the target to peer into alternate planes or dimensions. They can see into dimensional pockets and other planes that overlap with the one they are currently on. In addition, the target's visual range becomes supercharged.















# Combat

## When Combat Ensues

The first thing to realize is that not every instance of violence or fighting in your game needs to be broken down into blow-by-blow, round-by-round narration. The outcome of a simple bar fight, which might be important to the story but not particularly fun to play through,
could be decided using a few action rolls based around the core mechanic explained in Chapter 2. A final showdown with an evil necromancer fought upon air ships sailing through the clouds, on the other hand, is epic and fun enough to merit a blow-by-blow resolution. The GM is the final arbiter who decides when to start combat, and they can do so with three simple words: “Roll for initiative!”.

## Starting Combat

When the GM declares that combat will begin, the game is separated into rounds. Each round represents about six seconds of time in game, and during a round, each PC and each GM-controlled monster or NPC will receive one turn. Before combat begins, there are two things that must be done: determining surprise and rolling for initiative.

### Determining Surprise

In any combat, one or more combatants may be surprised if their enemy catches them off guard or unaware. For example, if a pack of bandits lays an ambush for the PCs in a rocky chasm, the GM may have every member of the party make a Perception roll contested by the bandits' Agility roll. Any PC who fails the check is surprised. The GM decides when some or all combatants may be surprised.

Surprised characters always act after non-surprised characters, as explained in the rules for initiative. Furthermore, until a surprised character takes their first turn, they may not take any interrupt actions and all attacks made against them gain advantage 1.

### Roll for Initiative

After surprise has been determined, each combatant makes an Agility action roll. The total of a combatant's Agility roll is their initiative score. The GM may decide to make one roll for each group of monsters instead of tracking every monster's initiative individually.

Write down all initiative scores from highest to lowest. When taking turns in combat, characters act in order from highest initiative score to lowest. In case of ties, characters act in order of their Agility scores (from high to low). If Agility scores are also tied, determine order randomly.

**Note:** If any character is wielding a weapon with the *swift* property at the beginning of combat, they gain advantage 2 on their initiative. A character may also gain this benefit even if they are not wielding the weapon at the beginning of combat, but in doing so they commit themselves to drawing the weapon on their first turn.

If any characters are surprised, keep two initiative orders: one for surprised combatants and one for non-surprised ones. All characters in the non-surprised order act first, after which characters in the surprised order act.

### Waiting to Act

If you do not wish to act when your turn comes, you may choose to defer your turn, either by waiting or by preparing to react in response to some sort of situation. If you wait, you may take your turn at any time after another character has finished their turn but before another character has begun.

If you are preparing to react, then you should give a general description of what you are preparing for, such as "I'll act when a threat to come through the door" or "I'm readying my bow to shoot at an enemy who goes for the altar." When the triggering action occurs, you may choose to take your turn even if it interrupts another character's turn (such as if they are in the process of moving). Once your turn is complete, any characters who you may have interrupted may complete their turn.

If, by the end of the round, your triggering conditions were not met, you may take your turn as usual.

## The Core Mechanic in Combat

The core mechanic of *Open Legend* is meant to inspire creativity in players and GMs so that the story always moves forward and so that no dice roll ever feels wasted. However, in combat, players typically make many more action rolls than usual, so the GM may feel overwhelmed if they are constantly trying to come up with new interpretations of a failed roll on the fly.

Some GMs might love that kind of challenge, and for them, **the core mechanic can be used in combat in the same way it is in every other part of the game**. GMs who want something a little more streamlined **may use the following modification** to the usual core mechanic in combat:


\NextTableColumns{OCT{1}}

| The Action Roll for Attacks |
| :-: |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.33}OLT{.67}}

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | The GM and the PC both choose 1: \
Deal 3 damage \
Inflict 1 bane of Power Level <= 3 \
Move 10' w/o opportunity attacks |

With these modified rules, a player's failed attack roll means that the player may not get what they were aiming for, but they get something. And it comes at a cost because the GM also gets to choose an effect. Remember, also, that the rules for interpreting a failed roll only apply to PCs. For the GM, a success is a success and a failure is a failure (See chapter 2 for more details).

### Why Succeed on a Failed Roll?

Some players might wonder why a PC still gets a taste of success even when their roll fails to meet the Challenge Rating. This might seem unrealistic because in movies and novels, for example, sometimes the bullet just misses or the sword fails to connect. In Open Legend, the "success with a twist" rules for combat ensure that a fight never gets stagnant. Even when the dice go against the player, the battle still builds to a cinematic conclusion as combatants shift around the battlefield and wear away at each other's reserves. Hit points represent more than just physical endurance and missing a target's defense score can mean more than just a shot going wide. Even if a hail of gunfire fails to penetrate an enemy's body armor, it might still weaken their resolve (*deal 3 damage*), force them to take cover (*inflict knockdown*), or give the attacker an opportunity to gain ground (*move 10'*).



## Using Attributes to Inflict Damage

Combat in *Open Legend* is a swirl of action rolls as blades clash, traps spring, lightning forks, and lasers fly. However, because of the free-form nature of storytelling in *Open Legend*, you may not always know what attributes can be used to make attacks.

### Always

Some attributes can pretty much always be used to deal damage. These include Might, Agility, Energy, and Entropy. These are the standards for swinging mauls, shooting guns, raining fire, draining life force, and so on.

### Sometimes

A few attributes can be used for damaging attacks in special circumstances in which the story dictates that the damage arises from your skill in the attribute. These include Logic, Protection, Alteration, Influence, and Movement. Though the occasions to use these attributes for damage will be rare, as long as the story makes sense, combatants should be able to damage foes with them. Examples of situations in which these attributes might be used in an action roll for a damaging attack are provided below.

**Logic.** Springing a trap on your foes.

**Protection.** Shielding yourself with a wall of magical knives.

**Alteration.** Causing a tree branch to strangle a foe.

**Influence.** For illusory effects that are convincing enough, any number could mimic damage until your enemy is aware of the trick. For mental compulsion, forcing a dominated enemy to stab himself.

**Movement.** Using telekinesis to hurl a boulder at a foe.

### Probably Never

The remaining attributes don't really lend themselves to damage. Without a VERY good explanation, the following cannot be used for damaging attacks: fortitude, learning, perception, will, deception, persuasion, presence, creation, prescience.

## Taking Your Turn

When your turn in the initiative order comes, you are allowed one major action, one move action, and any number of minor actions (though you may not take more than one minor action of the same type). In lieu of taking any of these actions, you may choose to take one focus action on your turn.


\NextTableColumns{OCT{.66}OCT{.34}}

| On your turn, you may take... | Or... |
| :-: | - |
| 1 Major Action*  | 1 Focus Action |
| 1 Move Action | |
| Any number of minor actions |

\* *Major action may be traded for a move action*


### Major Actions

Major actions are what you take to get big things done in combat. Your major action can be taken to do one of the following:

-   Make a damaging attack

-   Make a bane attack

-   Invoke a boon

-   Assist an Ally

-   Take an extra move action


Each of these actions is explained below.

> #### Combat on a Grid
> Many players prefer to conduct combat on a grid of squares using miniatures or tokens to represent combatants. In this style of play, each square on your grid represents a 5' by 5' square. Movement only occurs in increments of 5 feet, and you must have at least 5' of movement remaining in order to enter a new square. Combatants may not move diagonally across the corner of square containing a solid object that would restrict movement, such as a tree, building, or boulder.

#### Make a Damaging Attack

To attack a foe in an attempt to damage them, follow the steps in the Attack Summary chart, which are explained in further detail below. Every attack is either physical or extraordinary. Physical attacks typically involve weapons, claws, teeth, or other natural means of inflicting damage that rely on the attacker's Might or Agility attribute. Extraordinary attacks are those that make use of one of the attacker's extraordinary attributes, such as by using Energy to summon a ball of fire. A character can only make an extraordinary attack if they possess a score of 1 or higher in the relevant attribute.


**1. Determine Range**

**Melee weapon attacks** target foes that are within reach of you.

**Ranged weapon attacks** can target foes within their range at no penalty. Attacks suffer disadvantage 1 per extra range increment beyond the first, to a maximum of disadvantage 2 at three times the weapon's range.

**Extraordinary attacks** have a range according to the attribute being used, as detailed in the Extraordinary Attack Range table. Unlike projectile weapons, extraordinary attacks cannot extend beyond their normal range.

| **Step 3:** | Weapon Attacks target Guard |
| **Determine Targeted Defense** | Extraordinary Attacks target the most logical defense |
| | **Guard** if the attack requires dodging or deflection |
| | **Toughness** if the attack targets bodily health |
| | **Resolve** if the attack harms the psyche or will |

+++ {.CalloutInformation}

**Ranged Attacks in Melee**

Any time you make a ranged attack (weapon or extraordinary) and there is an enemy within melee reach of you, you have disadvantage 1 on your attack roll. Area attacks are considered ranged attacks if the area does not include at least one space adjacent to the attacker.
+++

**2. Determine Target(s)**

By default, your attacks target a single foe. However, you may choose to target multiple individual foes or to target an area. Targeting more than one foe causes disadvantage on your attack roll, as described below.

**Melee Multi-targeting**

You may target any number of foes that are within your reach. When targeting more than one foe, you suffer disadvantage equal to the number of foes targeted (2 targets = disadvantage 2, 3 targets = disadvantage 3, etc.)

**Ranged Multi-targeting**

You may target up to five foes that fall within a 25' square. When targeting more than one foe, you suffer disadvantage equal to the number of foes targeted, as with melee attacks.

**Area Multi-targeting**

You may choose from a variety of shapes when making an area attack as described below. Friends and foes alike that fall within the targeted area will be subject to your attack.

**Cube.** You target a cube with equal length, width, and height designated by you. The attack suffers disadvantage 1 per 5' of the cube's side. That is, a 5' cube suffers disadvantage 1, a 10' cube disadvantage 2, and so on.

**Line.** You target a line that is 5' wide, 10' long, and 10' high. You may create several lines as part of a single attack, as long as at least one corner of each line touches. For each line, the attack suffer disadvantage 1.

**Cone.** You target a cone that extends from your space to a length you designate. At any given point, the cone is as wide as it is long. Your attack suffers disadvantage 1 per 5' of length of the cone.

| **Cube** | Disadvantage = 1 per 5' of length of cube. |
| **Line** | Disadvantage = 1 per 5'x10'x10' line. |
| **Cone** | Disadvantage = 1 per 5' length of cone. |

**3. Determine Targeted Defense**

Every attack targets one of your foe's defenses: Toughness, Guard, or Resolve.

Weapon attacks always target Guard.

Extraordinary attacks are more open-ended and often require the GM to decide the type of defense targeted using the following guidelines:

- **Toughness** is used to defend against attacks that require bodily endurance, health, or sturdiness, such as poison and necrotic energy.
- **Guard** protects against attacks that can be dodged, deflected, or avoided by taking cover, such as a ball of flame or a magical wall of blades.
- **Resolve** guards against mental assaults and deceptions, such as attacks from a phantasmal beast or damage caused by an illusory pit.

**4. Roll Attack and Calculate Damage**

Make an action roll using the appropriate Attribute to determine the effectiveness of your attack. Forceful weapons use Might while Precise weapons use Agility. Extraordinary attacks use an attribute appropriate to the story (e.g., Energy for a fiery blast, Entropy for a disintegration ray).

You deal damage equal to your action roll minus the target's defense, ignoring negative results. This damage is subtracted from the target's hit points. If your attack roll exactly equals the target's defense, the attack should be interpreted as a *success with a twist* (differing slightly from the usual core mechanic).

**Exceptional Success**

If your damaging attack roll exceeds the target's defense by 10 or more, you may apply one bane of a Power Level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must
equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target.

#### Make a Bane Attack

Instead of attempting to damage a target, you may instead choose to inflict your enemy with a bane. In order to inflict a bane, you must possess an appropriate attribute of at least the bane's power level, as
detailed in the [*bane descriptions*](#banes-list). While targets may be effected by multiple banes, you may not *stack* banes; a target cannot be inflicted with a bane it is currently suffering from, unless specified in the boon's effect (*e.g.* *Fatigued*).

To resolve a bane attack, follow these steps:

**1. Determine Range and Target(s)**

Bane attacks follow the same rules for determining range and number of targets as damaging attacks.

**2. Determine Targeted Defense**

The targeted defense is determined by the type of bane being inflicted. Consult the [*bane descriptions*](#banes-list) to determine which defense to target.

**3. Roll Your Attack**

The [*bane descriptions*](#banes-list) also indicate which attributes can be used to inflict each bane. Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute. If your total equals or exceeds the target's defense score, your target suffers the bane.

#### Invoke a Boon

\ \

You can invoke boons in order to aid yourself or allies. In order to invoke a boon, you must possess an appropriate attribute of at least the boon's power level, as detailed in the
[*boon descriptions*](#Boons List). To invoke a boon, follow these steps:

**1. Determine Range and Target(s)**

Boon invocations follow the same rules for determining range and number of targets as damaging attacks.

**2. Roll to Invoke**

Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute, as determined by the [*boon descriptions*](#Boons List).

**3. Determine Power Level**

Some boons only possess a single power level, while others can be invoked at multiple power levels. Use the Boon Challenge Rating Table to determine the highest power level at which you can invoke the boon based on your action roll. Regardless of your roll, you cannot invoke a boon at a power level greater than the attribute you are using to invoke the boon. If you fail to meet the Challenge Rating of your boon's lowest power level, your invocation fails.

##### Boon Challenge Ratings

\ \

\NextTableColumns{OCT{.50}OCT{.50}}

| Power Level | Challenge Rating |
| - | - |
| 0 | 10 |
| 1 | 12 |
| 2 | 14 |
| 3 | 16 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 20 |
| 6 | 22 |
| 7 | 24 |
| 8 | 26 |
| 9 | 28 |


#### Assist an Ally

\ \

You can use your major action to assist an ally with an action roll if they are using an attribute you have a score of 1 or greater in. The ally automatically gets advantage 1 on their roll.

#### Take an Extra Move Action

\ \

On any turn, instead of taking a major action, you may use an extra move action.

### Move Actions

\ \

Move actions are typically what you take in order to maneuver around the battlefield, though you can also use them for a few other purposes. Move actions may be used to accomplish the following:

-   Move your speed

-   Take special movement

-   Resist banes

#### Move your speed

\ \

You may move up to your speed. The base speed for characters is 30'. This movement may be broken up by other actions. For example, you may move 10 feet, use a minor action to open a door, move 10 more feet, and then use your major action to attack a foe.

#### Take Special Movement

\ \

Special movement includes climbing, jumping, swimming, and other movement that is typically more restricted than just running across the battlefield.

**Jump**. Make a Might roll. You can move up to 10’ for free as a running start before jumping. If you do, you get advantage 1 for every 10' by which your speed exceeds 30'.

- **For a long jump,** you cover a number of feet equal to your roll.

- **For a high jump,** you cover a number of feet equal to your roll divided by 2.

**Climb**. You climb at half of your normal speed. The GM may require a Might or Agility check if the situation is particularly dangerous.

**Swim**. You swim at half of your normal speed. The GM may require a Might or Fortitude check if you are swimming a long distance, against a very strong current, or in similarly challenging situations.

#### Resist Banes

\ \

Instead of using your move action to maneuver, you may focus your energy on shaking off the negative effects of any banes currently afflicting you. For each bane affecting you, roll 1d20 (with no attribute modifiers). If your roll is a 10 or higher, the bane is removed. This roll is not considered an action roll, and thus is not affected by advantage or disadvantage.

Many banes will persist for a longer duration after three failed resist attempts to shake them off. As such, you should keep a tally of any banes which you to fail resist.

### Minor Actions

\ \

Minor actions are tasks that don't require much time or effort, but often set up larger actions. You may take any number of minor actions on your turn, but you cannot take more than one of the same type of minor action. Minor actions include the following:

-   Draw or sheathe a weapon
-   Retrieve an item stored on your person
-   Sustain a boon
-   Make a Perception roll to observe your surroundings
-   Make a Learning roll to recall useful information
-   Open a door, chest, drawer, etc.
-   Make an opportunity attack

#### Opportunity Attacks

\ \

An opportunity attack is a special kind of minor action because it does not take place during your turn. If you are wielding a melee weapon, and an enemy moves from a space within your reach to a space that is not within your reach, you may make a free attack against the enemy. (Note that, as a minor action, you may only make one opportunity attack per round).

Only voluntary movement made on the moving character's turn trigger opportunity attacks. Movement caused by a foe's *forced move* bane or an ally's *telekinesis* boon, for example, do not trigger opportunity attacks.

#### Sustaining Boons

\ \

Many boons have a default duration of *sustain persists*, which means that every time a character uses the **sustain** action, the boon remains in effect for 1 additional round. If you have a boon in effect and do not sustain it, the boon ends when your turn is over. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, you can normally only sustain one boon at a time, and you cannot sustain a boon on a round in which you take a focus action.

### Focus Actions

Using a focus action involves spending all of your energy and attention on one task. If you choose to forgo your major, move, and minor actions for a round, you may instead take a focus action. Choose one of the following types of focus action:

**Disrupting Attack.** Make a damaging attack using the normal attack rules. If your roll exceeds the target's defense by 10 or more, then any boons being sustained by your target immediately end.

**Superior Action.** Make any one action roll with advantage 1.

**Charge.** Move up to twice your speed and make one melee attack at disadvantage 1.

### Interrupt Actions

In some situations, you may want to take an action in response to another combatant's action. In these cases, you can use an interrupt action. However, whenever you use an interrupt action, you lose your major action the next time your turn in the initiative order comes up. You can use your interrupt action to attempt any of the following:

**Defend.** You may use a defend action after an enemy has rolled a successful attack against you or an ally in order to attempt to ward off the attack. Describe how you are defending and then make an action roll using an appropriate attribute (Protection, Agility, and Might are all typical examples of attributes used to defend). A single defend action can only be used to defend one target.

If your attribute roll is higher than the targeted defense score, then your roll replaces the targeted defense score for that attack only. (**Note:** Characters wielding a weapon with the *defensive* property gain advantage equal to the weapon's *defensive* value on their defend action roll).

As part of your defend action, you may also move up to half of your speed at any time during your action. If you are defending an ally and are adjacent to them at any point during your defend action, they may also move up to half of their speed. Neither you nor your ally provoke opportunity attacks with this movement. This movement cannot negate the orginal attack, even if it takes the defended character out of the reach or area of the attack.

**Improvise.** You may also use your interrupt action in order to improvise a response to a situation in combat. For example, if an ally falls off a cliff, you may use your interrupt action to invoke a levitate boon and save them. Improvised interrupt actions should generally be limited to non-offensive reactions meant to assist allies.

### Free Actions

If a feat, perk, boon, or other source grants a *Free Action*, that action can be performed without counting against the normal limits to your actions per turn.

## Damage and Healing

Your hit points (HP) are an abstract measure of your character's ability to ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. Whenever you take damage, your hit points are reduced, and whenever you receive healing they are increased.

### Finishing Blows

When you suffer a damaging attack while unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to defend yourself, the attack counts as a **finishing blow** and may cause immediate death. Your defense against a finishing blow does not include any bonus from your attributes. Furthermore, if a finishing blow deals any damage, you must make a Fortitude roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 plus half the damage dealt. If you fail this roll, you are dead.

### Reaching Zero Hit Points

When you reach zero HP, you fall unconscious. Your hit points cannot be reduced below zero. While unconscious, you are helpless and any attack made against you counts as a finishing blow. Any healing that you receive to bring your hit points above zero also causes you to regain consciousness.

### Healing After Combat

After a combat encounter ends and you have at least ten minutes to rest and catch your breath, your hit points return to their maximum if you are already conscious. If you are unconscious, you regain consciousness and all hit points after 2d4 hours.

\newpage


### Lethal Damage

Lethal damage is used sparingly in Open Legend as a way for GMs to paint a picture of injury consequences over time. This is especially helpful for grim and gritty storylines where effects of injury should extend beyond a combat encounter. A GM might incorporate a trap or environmental hazard that deals lethal damage. Since these situations occur outside of combat, normal damage would othewise have no long term effect on the story.

A creature's maximum hit point toal is reduced by the amount of lethal damage it has sustained. The maximum lethal damage a creature can accrue is equal to its maximum hit points. If a creature sustains lethal damage greater than or equal to its maximum hit point total, the creature is unconscious until it heals at least 1 hit point of lethal damage.

Lethal damage is more difficult to heal then regular damage, healing at a rate of 1 hit point per day per Fortitude attribute point (minimum of 1 hit point). With the full-time attendance of a capable healer or doctor, any number of characters who are located in the same area and avoid strenuous activity heal at an additional rate equal to their attendant's Creation, Presence, or Learning score. Multiple attendants do not cumulatively improve this accelerated healing rate (the bonus is simply equal to the highest score among attendants).

For example, a warrior with Fortitude 4 heals 4 lethal damage per day on their own. With the assistance of a physician with a learning score of 8, the same warrior would heal at a rate of 12 lethal damage per day.

+++ {.CalloutInformation}
** Critical Hits (Optional Rule) **

To add a more gritty realism to to a game, GMs can implement the optional critical hits rule.

Under this rule, whenever a natural 20 is rolled on the d20 used in a damaging attack roll, the attack inflicts some lethal damage. The amount of lethal damage is equal to the total of subsequent d20 rolls for that attack (i.e., the d20 explosion total), with a maximum equal to the damage dealt by the attack.

# Running the Game

### Rewarding the Players

The thrill of adventure, the satisfaction of character development, and the joy of seeing a plotline come to its fulfillment are all intrinsically rewarding events that keep players coming back to the gaming table week after week. But still, just as players of any game, your players will also enjoy good old-fashioned extrinsic motivators. In Open Legend, these sorts of rewards typically come in two forms: wealth and power.

#### How and When to Award XP

\ \

In Open Legend, the primary way that players gain more power is by gaining experience points (XP) and reaching higher character levels, thus increasing their attribute scores and unlocking new feats, banes, and boons. Every XP that players receive grants them 1 feat point and 3 attribute points, and every 3 XP results in a new level.

Rather than constantly awarding different experience point values to different monsters or types of challenges, Open Legend uses a very simple method of determining when players level up: the GM. That's right. You get to decide when your players gain more power. Here are two methods you can use to decide how to award XP:

**Big Milestones.** You could award a new level whenever the players complete a major quest, defeat a powerful foe, or neutralize a serious threat. With this method, you may want to plan out the big milestones that you can foresee being accomplished in your campaign. Whenever your players reach one of these milestones, you give them 3 XP and thus a new level. A milestone map might look something like this:

- **Level 2:** The heroes thwart one of the three foes threatening Woodshold.

- **Level 3:** The heroes discover the Cult of the Dragon.

- **Level 4:** The heroes prevent the cult's Ritual of Three
  from being completed.

- **Level 5:** The heroes retrieve the treasure at the bottom of the Sunken Star.

- **Level 6:** The heroes end the conflict between the barbarians and the Collectors.

- **Level 7:** The heroes free the village of Hilltop from the grasp of the vampire Tessa.

- **Level 8:** The heroes discover the secret of the Ruins of Mastika.

- **Level 9:** The heroes find a way to weaken Dezzer Kai's power over the land.

- **Level 10:** The heroes defeat Dezzer Kai.


**Time Played.** An easy way to schedule rewards is simply to give players 1 XP at the end of each session. This way, they'll always look forward to gaining that little extra bit of power that comes from attributes and feats. Occasionally, you may decide to switch it up a bit and award players with 2 or even 3 XP if they accomplished a particularly important goal. With this method, you don't have to plan out a campaign's milestones ahead of time, but you may need to adapt on the fly to your players' increasing power.

### Beyond 10th Level

Although officially, Open Legend was designed with a maximum character level of 10, there is no reason you can't extend your campaign beyond this threshold if you are up for the challenge (higher level characters can be difficult to manage and properly engineer challenges for). Feel free to continue the campaign for as many levels as is fun for both you and your players. To do so, simply continue the established progression of 3 XP to gain a new level, with each XP also providing 1 feat point and 3 attribute points.

#### All That Glitters: Giving Players More Wealth

In addition to power, most players enjoy being able to have more influence on the campaign world by amassing hoards of treasure. With money comes the ability to buy better equipment, employ hirelings, construct fortifications, and even raise armies.

Chapter 4 explains Open Legend's simplified wealth system, and the Wealth Overview Table indicates the typical wealth score of PCs at varying experience levels. Players start with a wealth score of 2 and it will increase whenever the GM decides. Just as experience levels represent a vast increase in power, new wealth scores drastically improve the players' access to valuable goods. A character who goes from wealth 3 to 4, for example, has progressed from being able to purchase a fine horse to being able to buy a siege engine.

You can use this table as a rough guideline for when to give players more wealth, particularly if you have also created an outline of milestones for granting experience levels. For example, the table shows that by 4th level, a typical character should have progressed to wealth score 4. Using the experience level milestone plan detailed previously, we could decide that after stopping the first threat to Woodshold, the people of the town take up a collection to reward the heroes. We can also plan to give the Cult of the Dragon a horde of treasure that will again increase the party's wealth score.

However you plan to award wealth, you can see that the general recommendation on the table is for a PC's wealth score to increase twice every three levels.

If you or your players have a background with other game systems, in which they may have regularly looted every corpse, scavenged every piece of equipment, and dutifully tracked every single gold piece, then Open Legend's wealth system might initially feel a bit awkward. If it does, consider some of the following tips:

**NPCs still have stuff on them.** Just because you don't need to spend hours tracking every piece of loot that the players cut from a corpse doesn't mean that they don't have stuff on them. It just fades into the background so that you can focus on the story.

Think of any movie or novel. How often does the action focus on the characters picking at the defeated bodies of the antagonists? Rarely. And, if they do take something from a foe, it's usually to serve the plot.

So, when a combat encounter ends, instead of listing off how many crossbow bolts each bandit has on them, just tell the party that they find a few valuables to add to their ever-growing stash, but that it's still not enough to increase their wealth score. If a player does legitimately need another clip of ammo or another dagger or a new cloak, then you can decide whether or not it makes sense for the NPCs to have them.

**Wealth represents influence.** Since players aren't tracking individual gold pieces, dollars, or gems, situations like bribery might initially prove to be a bit sticky. But a good guideline is that a character can easily use money to influence someone else of a lower wealth score.

If the recipient of the bribe has the **same wealth score** as the character, then it would be considered a “major expense”, which means that it can be done, but the expense taxes resources such that new goods at that level or higher can't be acquired for two weeks. If the bribe recipient is **one wealth level higher** than the character's Wealth Score, the cost is so great that the character's Wealth Score is permanently reduced by 1. Bribing someone more than one Wealth level higher is impossible without other factors in play.

So, a character with a wealth score of 2 will be inconvenienced in bribing a town guard, and a character probably needs a wealth score of 5 before they can easily bribe powerful political figures like the town mayor.

Keep these same guidelines in mind when it comes to arbitrating similar situations, such as players trying to hire laborers, schmooze with bigwigs, or impress a crowd with their wealth.

### Monsters and NPC Statistics

Many of the monsters and NPCs that the PCs encounter throughout their journey will be used solely for the purposes of role playing or setting the mood. These sort of background characters typically don't need a full array of attributes, feats, and favored banes because, more likely than not, you'll never make a single action roll for them. Angus the Blacksmith, for example, might spice up the town bazaar a bit with his Scottish accent and epic tales of fraudulent accomplishments - but your party is never going to need to engage him in combat.

A good deal of your monsters and NPCs, however, will require statistical descriptions to use for combat or social encounters. This section will describe two ways that you can build these statistics: the complex build and the simple build.

#### Complex Build

When designing an NPC using the complex build, you simply create the NPC as if it was a player character. Select an appropriate level and use the instructions in chapter one to assign attributes, feats, and other defining characteristics.

The complex build is a good option when you are creating a very important villain or ally who will play a major role in the story line. This process can take a while, so it's not worth going through with underlings, henchmen, or beasts who are only going to be present for a single scene.

#### Simple Build

The simple build option is useful when you need to come up with statistics on the fly. For example, imagine the party fails an action roll to move stealthily through a swamp to avoid the local denizens. You decide that they have attracted the attention of a handful of poisonous serpents that lair in the swamp, but you don't have any stats written up for these monsters. In this situation, you could use the simple build rules to get combat rolling quickly.

Use the NPC Simple Build Table to determine the monster's most relevant statistics. For the hit point and defense columns, choose values within the given ranges based on the strengths and weaknesses of the monster you are building. Choose 1 to 3 primary attributes that will form the main basis of the monster's attacks and actions, and then choose as many secondary attributes as you need in order to define the monster's other capabilities.


#### NPC Simple Build

| 2 | 12 - 24 | 11 - 18 | 5 | 3 |

Once you have the basic statistics recorded, choose a few of the following feats to provide your monster with special attacks and abilities:

- **Attack Specialization (tier equal to NPC level, max 9):** With one attack type, gain advantage 1 per tier. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or boon invocations.

- **Bane Focus:** Pick a bane you can invoke. Whenever a damaging attack exceeds the target's defense by 5 or more, you may automatically inflict that bane.

- **Bane Resistance (tier 1 - 2, your choice, available only to GMs):** Choose a bane and gain the following benefits:

  - **Tier 1:** Gain +5 to your defense against the chosen bane.
  - **Tier 2:** You are immune to the chosen bane.

- **Superior Bane Focus (available only to GMs):** Pick a bane you can invoke. Whenever you inflict at least one damage with an attack, you may automatically inflict that bane.

- **Boon Focus (tier 1 - 3, your choice):** Pick a boon you can invoke. Gain the following benefits:

    - **Tier 1:** When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.

     - **Tier 2:** You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action, beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.

    - **Tier 3:** The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:
      <br />
      <strong>If the chosen boon has a duration of "sustain persists"</strong>, you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, the boon is always active for your character and persists each round as a free action, rather than a minor action. If the boon is somehow temporarily canceled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action.
      <br />
      <strong>If the boon has a different duration</strong>, you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.

- **Damage Resistance (tier 1 - 3, your choice, available only to GMs):** Choose a either Precise or Forceful and gain the following benefits:

    - **Tier 1:** Your defense scores are increased by 3 against the chosen damage type.
    - **Tier 2:** Your defense scores are increased by 6 against the chosen damage type.
    - **Tier 3:** Your defense scores are increased by 9 against the chosen damage type.
    - **Tier 4:** You are immune to damage and harmful effects from the chosen damage type.

- **Energy Resistance (tier 1 - 4, your choice):** Choose an energy type and gain the following benefits:

    - **Tier 1:** Your defense scores are increased by 3 against the chosen energy type.
    - **Tier 2:** Your defense scores are increased by 6 against the chosen energy type.
    - **Tier 3:** Your defense scores are increased by 9 against the chosen energy type.
    - **Tier 4:** You are immune to damage and harmful effects from the chosen energy type.

- **Evasive Footwork:** When you move from a space adjacent to an enemy to another space not adjacent to that enemy, the enemy does not get the usual opportunity attack.

- **Lethal Strike (tier equal to NPC level, max 9):** Lethal strikes can be delivered to do lethal damage (that does not heal normally) under specific circumstances. There are two different ways to deliver a lethal strike:
    1. Catch an enemy by surprise, either due to not seeing you via Agility or through disguise / subterfuge via Deception.
    2. If an enemy is adjacent to an ally wielding a melee weapon, then you can make a lethal strike against that enemy.

    If one of the above conditions is met, you can deliver a lethal strike, which grants advantage and deals lethal damage in accordance with your tier and is difficult to recover from. Each tier below has an amount of advantage and a max lethal damage. If you deal damage up to the lethal threshold, then the lethal damage equals your damage total. If you deal more damage than the lethal threshold, you deal lethal damage equal to the threshold.

    - **Tier 1** - Advantage 1, Max lethal damage 5
    - **Tier 2** - Advantage 2, Max lethal damage 5
    - **Tier 3** - Advantage 3, Max lethal damage 10
    - **Tier 4** - Advantage 4, Max lethal damage 10
    - **Tier 5** - Advantage 5, Max lethal damage 15
    - **Tier 6** - Advantage 6, Max lethal damage 20
    - **Tier 7** - Advantage 7, Max lethal damage 20
    - **Tier 8** - Advantage 8, Max lethal damage 25
    - **Tier 9** - Advantage 9, Max lethal damage 25

- **Multi-Attack Specialist (tier equals NPC level, max 6):** Before attacking, you may declare that you are multi-attacking, and must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. ALL of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of additional attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 3; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 6). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1.

You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging attacks, but you may not invoke boons. Resolve each attack individually, applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same creature more than once. There is no limit to the number of additional attacks you can make using this feat.

- **Multi-Target Attack Specialist (tier equals NPC level, max 5):** Choose either area, ranged, or melee when you take this feat. For each tier, you offset the disadvantage penalty associated with multi-targeting by 1. So, when you would normally get disadvantage 2, you instead get disadvantage 1 and so on.

- **Multi-Bane Specialist:** Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining knockdown and slowed, both power level 2, would require an attribute score of 4). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately.

- **Potent Bane:** Choose a bane. When you invoke the chosen bane on a target, Resist rolls to shake off the bane have disadvantage 1.

- **Resilient:** Any time you roll to Resist, you have advantage 1 on the roll.

- **Superior Concentration (tier 1 - 3, your choice):** When you take the *sustain a boon* minor action, you may sustain one additional boon per tier of this feat which you possess.

**Special:** This feat can be purchased multiple times (up to a maximum of 3), each time it is purchased you can maintain one more boon with the Sustain minor action.


#### Boss NPCs

A Boss is a single monster or NPC that is capable of taking on a group of characters due to extraordinary prowess in combat. Bosses could be epic villains that the party has been pursuing for the entire campaign, such as the Lich King Akrakus, or they could be monstrous beasts with little backstory that simply serve as a dramatic milestone in the course of a larger adventure, such as a bridge troll that must be defeated before the PCs can progress. Other examples of bosses include the Kraken, a legendary gunslinger, a dragon, or the general of an alien armada.

When you decide that one of your monsters or NPCs merits boss status, use the Boss NPC Build Table to generate statistics in the same way you would if using the simple build rules described previously. You'll notice that bosses have more hit points, higher defenses, and better attributes in order to account for their ability to take on entire parties of PCs alone. When using the complex build, you can alter your villain's hit points and defenses based on this table to better represent the appropriate strength of a boss.

**Boss Edge**

A boss is a force to be reckoned with, and as such, it is more powerful in a number of ways. A boss cannot be subject to a finishing blow unless its hit point total has been reduced to zero. A boss NPC gets advantage on all attack rolls equal to its boss edge value.

In addition to its normal allotment of actions, a boss also receives a number of boss actions on its turn equal to its boss edge score. Each boss action is a single major action that does not count against its normal action limit. Each boss action is resolved at a separate position in the initiative order. Start with the boss's usual array of actions on their initiative roll. The first boss action happens immediately after the initiative of the next lowest PC in the initiative order. Continue staggering boss actions to follow the next lowest PC until there are no more boss actions or no more PC initiatives. Any remaining boss actions happen at the end of the round.

## Planning Combat Encounters

The build rules just explained help you create individual monsters or NPCs for the heroes to combat, and this section will assist you in building exciting scenarios for those battles.

### Encounter Difficulty

When designing a combat encounter, decide if you want it to be easy, moderate, or hard. An **easy encounter** shouldn't present a significant threat to the PCs unless luck is wildly against them or they make a series of poor decisions. A **moderate encounter** will challenge the PCs, but they are still likely to come out on top. A **hard encounter** will push them to the limits, and may end in defeat or the death of one or more characters.

Use the Encounter Difficulty Table to determine how many total monster levels you should include in your combat.

\NextTableColumns{OLT{.40}OCT{.60}}

| Encounter Difficulty | Total Monster Level |
| :-: | :-: |
| Easy  | Total Party Level x .5 |
| Moderate | Total Party Level x 1 |
| Hard | Total Party Level x 2 |

For example, a moderate encounter for a group of 4 PCs who are all 5th level would have a Total Monster Level of 20. An easy encounter for the same group would have a Total Monster Level of 10, and a hard encounter 40.

Whether you are using the simple or complex method of building your NPCs, you can spend your monster level budget until you reach approximately the designated total monster level for your encounter.

#### Bosses

If your encounter includes boss NPCs, multiply their level by 4 for purposes of budgeting (i.e., a 5th level boss would be worth 20 levels).

#### Minions

When designing an encounter, you may want to designate some monsters as minions, or easily dispensable grunts that still pose a threat to the party. You can trade any monster for three minions of the same level. Minions have the same stats as any other monster of their level, but their hit points are divided by four. Essentially, minions.

For example, imagine you are planning an easy encounter with a horde of goblins for a group of six 1st level heroes. Your monster level budget would only allow you to include six 1st level monsters, but you decide to replace them all with minions, allowing you to include 18 goblins.

### Ad Hoc Damage

Sometimes in your encounters and adventures, you might have the party take damage from sources other than enemy attacks. For example, the party fails to scour an old battlefield and ends up setting off a chain of land mines. Or maybe someone gets knocked into a pool of lava while invading the red dragon's volcanic lair. Other common sources of ad hoc damage include falling, acid, and frostbite.

In situations like these, in which the damage dealt isn't tied to an attack roll targeting a specific defense, you can roll straight damage dice against the affected characters. Simply pick an appropriate severity level from the Ad Hoc Damage table and roll the dice indicated, calculating exploding dice as usual. You can use the descriptions in the table to help you choose a severity level, or you can use these rough guidelines:

**Light Damage (Severity Level 1 - 4):** The damage is likely to be a minor nuisance, but not particularly threatening to the character.

**Moderate Damage (Severity Level 5 - 7):** The damage is serious, but probably won't knock the character out of action.

**Heavy Damage (Severity Level 8 - 9):** The damage is life threatening, and could easily knock a character out of action in the right circumstances.

| Severity Level | Damage | Examples |
| :-:            |  :-:   | :-:      |
| 1              | 1d4    | Falling 10', falling into a small campfire|
| 2              | 1d6    | Falling 20', 24 hours exposure to extreme temperature|
| 3              | 1d8    | Falling 30', spiked pit trap|
| 4              | 1d10   | Falling 40', catching on fire|
| 5              | 2d6    | Falling 50', a small cave-in|
| 6              | 2d8    | Falling 60', a car crash|
| 7              | 2d10   | Falling 70', falling into acid|
| 8              | 3d8    | Falling 80', a plane crash|
| 9              | 3d10   | Falling 90'+, falling into lava |

The GM has the option to make any ad hoc damage *lethal damage*. Typically, this is the case with damage that occurs outside of combat, such as by a trap or environmental hazard.
