# Chapter 6: Combat #

Sometimes, the well-meaning but far too honest paladin blows your cover.

Sometimes, the trigger-happy sorcerer gives away your position.

Sometimes, negotiations fail.

That’s when combat ensues. In this chapter, you’ll learn all the rules for fighting strategic and epic battles.

## When Combat Ensues

The first thing to realize is that not every instance of violence or fighting in your game needs to be broken down into blow-by-blow, round-by-round narration. The outcome of a simple bar fight, which might be important to the story but not particularly fun to play through,
could be decided using a few action rolls based around the core mechanic explained in Chapter 2. A final showdown with an evil necromancer fought upon air ships sailing through the clouds, on the other hand, is epic and fun enough to merit a blow-by-blow resolution. The GM is the final arbiter who decides when to start combat, and she does so with three simple words: “Roll for initiative!”.

## Starting Combat

When the GM declares that combat will begin, the game is separated into rounds. Each round represents about six seconds of time in game, and during a round, each PC and each GM-controlled monster or NPC will receive one turn. Before combat begins, there are two things that must be done: determining surprise and rolling for initiative.

### Determining Surprise

In any combat, one or more combatants may be surprised if their enemy catches them off guard or unaware. For example, if a pack of bandits lays an ambush for the PCs in a rocky chasm, the GM may have every member of the party make a Perception roll contested by the bandits’ Agility roll. Any PC who fails the check is surprised. The GM decides when some or all combatants may be surprised.

Surprised characters always act after non-surprised characters, as explained in the rules for initiative. Furthermore, until a surprised character takes their first turn, they may not take any interrupt actions and all attacks made against them gain advantage 1.

### Roll for Initiative

After surprise has been determined, each combatant makes an Agility action roll. The total of a combatant’s Agility roll is his initiative score. The GM may decide to make one roll for each group of monsters instead of tracking every monster’s initiative individually.

Write down all initiative scores from highest to lowest. When taking turns in combat, characters act in order from highest initiative score to lowest.

**Note:** If any character is wielding a weapon with the *swift* property at the beginning of combat, he gains advantage on his initiative roll equal to the weapon’s *swift* value (i.e., *swift* 2 provides advantage 2). A character may also gain this benefit even if they are not wielding the weapon at the beginning of combat, but in doing so they commit themselves to drawing the weapon on their first turn.

If any characters are surprised, keep two initiative orders: one for surprised combatants and one for non-surprised ones. All characters in the non-surprised order act first, after which characters in the surprised order act.

**Example of Initiative and Surprise**

Spaz and Jalani are exploring the crash site of an Armada Star Cruiser for salvage when they are ambushed by a pack of Mugworm Griblicks.

Spaz and Jalani roll Agility checks to determine initiative, and the GM makes one roll for the Griblicks as a group. Jalani announces that she'll be drawing her Las Pistol, which has the *swift 1* property, granting her advantage 1 on her Agility roll. Spaz was rummaging through a closet at the moment of attack, so the GM rules that he is surprised.

Spaz (Agility 2) rolls 1d20 + 1d6, and gets a 14.

Jalani (Agility 4) rolls 1d20 + 2d10 (keeping the highest d10), and gets a 25.

The Griblicks (Agility 3) roll 1d20 + 1d8, and get an 11.

The final initiative order is as follows:

**Non-surprised Combatants**

  Jalani 25 (On her first turn, she must draw her Las Pistol)

  Griblicks 11

**Surprised Combatants**

  Spaz 14

## The Core Mechanic in Combat

The core mechanic of *Open* *Legend* is meant to inspire creativity in players and GMs so that the story always moves forward and so that no dice roll ever feels wasted. However, in combat, players typically make many more action rolls than usual, so the GM may feel overwhelmed if she is constantly trying to come up with new interpretations of a failed roll on the fly.

Some GMs might love that kind of challenge, and for them, **the core mechanic can be used in combat in the same way it is in every other part of the game**. GMs who want something a little more streamlined **may use the following modification** to the usual core mechanic in combat:

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| The Action Roll for Attacks <br /> Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |
| - |
| |

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | The GM and the PC both choose 1: <br /> -<br /> Deal 5 damage <br /> Inflict 1 bane of Power Level <= 3 <br /> Move 10’ w/o opportunity attacks |


With these modified rules, a player’s failed attack roll means that the player may not get what they were aiming for, but they get something. And it comes at a cost because the GM also gets to choose an effect.

Remember, also, that the rules for interpreting a failed roll only apply to PCs. For the GM, a success is a success and a failure is a failure (See chapter 2 for more details).

### Example

*Vera hurls herself at the red dragon attempting to cut through his
scaly hide. However, her attack roll fails to hit the dragon’s toughness
of 25. She chooses to inflict 5 damage, but the GM also gets a choice.
He chooses to inflict the knockdown bane: The dragon’s tail lashes
around and sweeps Vera to the floor.*

## Using Attributes to Inflict Damage

Combat in *Open Legend* is a swirl of action rolls as blades clash, traps spring, lightning forks, and arrows fly. However, because of the free-form nature of storytelling in *Open Legend*, you may not always know what attributes can be used to make attacks.

### Always

Some attributes can pretty much always be used to deal damage. These include Might, Agility, Energy, and Entropy. These are the standards for swinging mauls, slinging arrows, raining fire, draining life force, and so on.

### Sometimes

A few attributes can be used for damaging attacks in special circumstances in which the story dictates that the damage arises from your skill in the attribute. These include Logic, Protection, Alteration, Influence, and Movement. Though the occasions to use these attributes for damage will be rare, as long as the story makes sense, combatants should be able to damage foes with them. Examples of situations in which these attributes might be used in an action roll for a damaging attack are provided below.

**Logic.** Springing a trap on your foes.

**Protection.** Shielding yourself with a wall of magical knives.

**Alteration.** Causing a tree branch to strangle a foe.

**Influence.** For illusory effects that are convincing enough, any number could mimic damage until your enemy is aware of the trick. For supernatural compulsion, forcing a dominated enemy to stab himself.

**Movement.** Using telekinesis to hurl a boulder at a foe.

### Probably Never

The remaining attributes don’t really lend themselves to damage. Without a VERY good explanation, the following cannot be used for damaging attacks: fortitude, learning, perception, will, deception, persuasion, presence, creation, prescience.

## Taking Your Turn

When your turn in the initiative order comes, you are allowed one major action, one move action, and any number of minor actions (though you may not take more than one minor action of the same type). In lieu of taking any of these actions, you may choose to take one focus action on your turn.

| On your turn, you may take... | Or... |
| :- | :- |
| 1 Major Action* <br /> 1 Move Action <br />  Any number of minor actions | 1 Focus Action |


*Major action may be traded for a move action*

### Major Actions

Major actions are what you take to get big things done in combat. Your major action can be taken to do any of the following:

-   Make a damaging attack

-   Make a bane attack

-   Invoke a boon

-   Assist an Ally

-   Take an extra move action


Each of these actions is explained below.

#### Make a Damaging Attack

To attack a foe in an attempt to damage them, follow the steps in the
Attack Summary chart, which are explained in further detail below.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| The Action Roll for Attacks <br /> Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |
| - |
| |

<div class="table-no-head"></div>
| | |
| - | - |
| **Step 1: Determine Range** | **Melee** = Within your reach <br /> **Projectile** = Weapon range (Disadvantage 1 per extra range increment) <br /> **Supernatural** <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - 3 = 25’ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - 6 = 50’ <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 - 9 = 75’ |
| **Step 2: Determine Targets** | *If more than one target...*  <br /> **Melee** = Disadvantage equals total # of targets <br /> **Ranged** = Disadvantage equals total # of targets (Max 5 targets within 25’ square) <br /> **Area** = Disadvantage 1 per 5’ length of square |
| **Step 3: Determine Targeted Defense** | Weapon Attacks <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Precise** targets Evasion <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Forceful** targets Toughness <br /><br /> Supernatural Attacks <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Melee** targets Toughness <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Area** target’s Toughness <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Projectile** target’s Evasion |
| **Step 4: Roll Attack and Calculate Damage** | **Damage dealt** = Attack Roll minus Defense <br /><br />On 10+ damage, inflict one bane as well |

##### 1. Determine Range

**Melee weapon attacks** target foes that are within reach of you.

**Projectile weapon attacks** can target foes within their range at no penalty. Attacks suffer disadvantage 1 per extra range increment beyond the first, to a maximum of disadvantage 2 at three times the weapon’s range.

**Supernatural attacks** have a range according to the attribute being used, as detailed in the Supernatural Attack Range table. Unlike projectile weapons, supernatural attacks cannot extend beyond their normal range.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Supernatural Attack Range |
| - |
| |
<div class="table-no-head"></div>
| | | | |
| - | - | - | - |
| Attribute Score | 1 - 3 | 4 - 6 | 7 - 9 |
| Range | 25 feet | 50 feet | 75 feet |

<br><br>

> **Ranged Attacks in Melee**
>
> Any time you make a projectile weapon or supernatural attack and there is an enemy within melee reach of you, you have disadvantage 1 on your attack roll.
>
> **Note:** For supernatural attacks, this penalty does not apply if you are targeting an adjacent enemy, because you would not be making a ranged attack.

<br><br>

##### 2. Determine Target(s)

By default, your attacks target a single foe. However, you may choose to target multiple individual foes or to target an area. Targeting more than one foe causes disadvantage on your attack roll, as described below.

**Melee Multi-Attacks**

You may target any number of foes that are within your reach. When targeting more than one foe, you suffer disadvantage equal to the number of foes targeted (2 targets = disadvantage 2, 3 targets = disadvantage 3, etc.)

**Projectile Multi-Attacks**

You may target up to five foes that fall within a 25' square. When targeting more than one foe, you suffer disadvantage equal to the number of foes targeted, as with melee attacks.

**Area Attacks**

Designate the length of the square you would like to target in increments of 5 feet. For each 5 feet of length, you suffer one level of disadvantage (10’x10’ square = disadvantage 2, 15’x15’ square equals disadvantage 3, etc.).

Friends and foes alike that fall within the targeted area will be subject to your attack, but you will not. Additionally, if you target at least one square that is adjacent to you, you do not provoke opportunity attacks for this attack.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Multi-Targeting Summary |
| - |
| |
<div class="table-no-head"></div>
| | |
| - | - |
| **Melee Attacks** | Disadvantage = number of targets. |
| **Projectile Attacks** | Disadvantage = number of targets. <br /> Max 5 targets. Must be within a 25’ square. |
| **Area Attacks** | Disadvantage = 1 per 5’ of length of square targeted. |

##### 3. Determine Targeted Defense

Every attack targets one of your foe’s defenses: toughness, evasion, or resolve.

For weapon attacks, the defense targeted depends on the type of weapon. Weapons with the *forceful* property target the foe’s toughness, while  weapons with the *precise *property target evasion. If you are wielding a weapon that is both *forceful* and *precise*, you get to choose whether to use Agility to target Evasion or Might to target Toughness.

Supernatural attacks are more open-ended and often require the GM to decide the type of defense targeted. In general, however, supernatural melee or area attacks target a foe’s toughness while supernatural projectile attacks target a foe’s evasion.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Standard Defense vs. Attack Types |
| - |
| |

| Attack Type | Defense |
| :- | :- |
| Precise weapons | Evasion |
| Forceful weapons | Toughness |
| Supernatural melee attacks | Toughness |
| Supernatural area attacks | Toughness |
| Supernatural projectile attacks | Evasion |

##### 4. Roll Attack and Calculate Damage

Make an action roll using the appropriate Attribute to determine the effectiveness of your attack. Forceful weapons use Might while Precise weapons use Agility. Supernatural attacks use an attribute appropriate to the story (e.g., Energy for a fiery blast, Entropy for a disintegration ray).

The Challenge Rating for your roll is the target’s defense score. If you succeed, the target takes damage equal to your action roll minus the targeted defense. This damage is subtracted from the target’s hit points.

**Exceptional Success**

If your attack roll exceeds the target’s defense by 10 or more, you may apply one bane of a Power Level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must
equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target.

#### Make a Bane Attack

Instead of attempting to damage a target, you may instead choose to inflict your enemy with a bane. In order to inflict a bane, you must possess an appropriate attribute of at least the bane’s power level, as
detailed in the [*bane descriptions*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes).

To resolve a bane attack, follow these steps:

##### 1. Determine Range and Target(s)

Bane attacks follow the same rules for determining range and number of targets as damaging attacks.

##### 2. Determine Targeted Defense

The targeted defense is determined by the type of bane being inflicted. Consult the [*bane descriptions*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes) to determine which defense to target.

##### 3. Roll Your Attack

The [*bane descriptions*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes) also indicate which attributes can be used to inflict each bane. Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute. If your total equals or exceeds the target’s defense score, your target suffers the bane.

**Example Bane Attacks**

Setting Sun is heavily wounded and needs a chance to escape from the samurai who is mercilessly pressing the attack. With a well timed snake strike, the monk attempts to blind the armored warrior. Setting Sun is making a melee attack targeting a single foe, so he makes an action roll using his Agility of 5 versus the samurai's Evasion of 18. The monk rolls 1d20 + 2d6 and scores a 20, so his foe is inflicted with the *blinded* bane.

Zarthakis, the great wyrm, is surrounded by a party of 4 adventurers. He unfurls the full fury of his wings and bellows a mighty roar, instilling terror in his foes as he attempts to inflict the Demoralized Bane using his Presence attribute. The dragon's Presence is 8, giving him a range of 75', quite enough to target all of the heroes. Because Zarthakis is multi-targeting 4 foes, he has disadvantage 4 on his action roll. Normally, he would roll 1d20 + 3d8, but because he has disadvantage, the wyrm rolls 1d20 + 7d8 (keeping the lowest 3 d8s). His total score is 22, which he compares to each target's Resolve defense score separately. The heroes have Resolve scores of 14, 17, 22, and 25, so the dragon manages to inflict the bane on three of the four.

#### Invoke a Boon

You can invoke boons in order to aid yourself or allies. In order to invoke a boon, you must possess an appropriate attribute of at least the boon’s power level, as detailed in the
[*boon descriptions*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/boons). To invoke a boon, follow these steps:

##### 1. Determine Range and Target(s)

Boon invocations follow the same rules for determining range and number of targets as damaging attacks.

##### 2. Roll to Invoke

Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute, as determined by the [*boon descriptions*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/boons). 

##### 3. Determine Power Level

Some boons only possess a single power level, while others can be invoked at multiple power levels. Use the Boon Challenge Rating Table to determine the highest power level at which you can invoke the boon based on your action roll. Regardless of your roll, you cannot invoke a boon at a power level greater than the attribute you are using to invoke the boon. If you fail to meet the Challenge Rating of your boon's lowest power level, your invocation fails.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Boon Challenge Rating |
| - |
| |
<div class="table-centered"></div>
| Power Level | Challenge Rating |
| - | - |
| 0 | 10 |
| 1 | 12 |
| 2 | 14 |
| 3 | 16 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 20 |
| 6 | 22 |
| 7 | 24 |
| 8 | 26 |
| 9 | 28 |

**Example Boon Invocations**

Jade attempts to activate his reality distorter in order to make herself and an ally vanish with the *invisible* boon. Jade's Alteration attribute is 6, but she suffers disadvantage 2 due to multi-targeting. She rolls 1d20 + 4d8 (keeping the lowest 2 d8s) and gets a 20. *Invisible* is Power Level 6, so Jade falls short of the Challenge Rating of 22. The boon fails to take effect.

Stitch is attempting to close an ally's wounds by invoking the *Heal* boon. His Learning attribute is 5, so he rolls 1d20 + 2d6 and gets a total of 24. According to the Boon Challenge Rating table, Stitch rolled high enough to invoke the boon at power level 7. However, because his Learning attribute is 5, he can only invoke *heal* at power level 5, allowing him to heal his ally 2d6 hit points according to the boon description.

#### Assist an Ally

You can use your major action to assist an ally with an action roll if they are using an attribute you have a score of 1 or greater in. The ally automatically gets advantage 1 on their roll.

#### Take an Extra Move Action

On any turn, instead of taking a major action, you may use an extra move action.

### Move Actions

Move actions are typically what you take in order to maneuver around the battlefield, though you can also use them for a few other purposes. Move actions may be used to accomplish the following:

-   Move your speed
-   Take special movement
-   Resist banes

#### Move your speed

You may move up to your speed. The base speed for characters is 30'. This movement may be broken up by other actions. For example, you may move 10 feet, use a minor action to open a door, move 10 more feet, and then use your major action to attack a foe.

#### Take Special Movement

Special movement includes climbing, jumping, swimming, and other movement that is typically more restricted than just running across the battlefield.

**Jump**. Make a Might roll. If you can’t get at least a 10’ running start, you have disadvantage 1.

- **For a long jump,** you cover a number of feet equal to your roll.
- **For a high jump,** you cover a number of feet equal to your roll divided by 2.

**Climb**. You climb at half of your normal speed. The GM may require a Might or Agility check if the situation is particularly dangerous.

**Swim**. You swim at half of your normal speed. The GM may require a Might or Fortitude check if you are swimming a long distance, against a very strong current, or in similarly challenging situations.

#### Resist Banes

Instead of using your move action to maneuver, you may focus your energy on shaking off the negative effects of any banes currently afflicting you. For each bane affecting you, roll 1d20 (with no attribute modifiers). If your roll is a 10 or higher, the bane is removed.

Many banes will persist for a longer duration if you fail three resist rolls to shake them off. As such, you should keep a tally of any banes which you to fail resist .

**Example**

After standing toe-to-toe with an Ichor Demon for six rounds, Garcon is afflicted with three banes: *persistent damage*, *slowed*, and *blinded*. He uses his move action to attempt to resist these banes, so he rolls a d20 for each one, getting an 8, 16, and 9, respectively. Therefore, Garcon manages to shake off *slowed*, but he is still suffering from *persistent damage* and *blinded*. He notes on his character sheet that he has failed to resist each of these banes once.

### Minor Actions

Minor actions are tasks that don’t require much time or effort, but often set up larger actions. You may take any number of minor actions on your turn, but you cannot take more than one of the same type of minor action. Minor actions include the following:

-   Draw a weapon
-   Retrieve an item stored on your person
-   Sustain a boon
-   Make a Perception roll to observe your surroundings
-   Make a Learning roll to recall useful information
-   Open a door, chest, drawer, etc.
-   Make an opportunity attack

#### Opportunity Attacks

An opportunity attack is a special kind of minor action because it does not take place during your turn. If you are wielding a melee weapon, and an enemy moves from a space within your reach to a space that is not within your reach, you may make a free attack against the enemy. (Note that, as a minor action, you may only make one opportunity attack per round).

Only voluntary movement made on the moving character's turn trigger opportunity attacks. Movement caused by a foe's *forced move* bane or an ally's *telekinesis* boon, for example, do not trigger opportunity attacks.

**Opportunity Attack Examples**

Tommy has no choice but to flee from the three orcs that have closed upon him. He moves as far as he can to get away from them. However, because he moved from a space adjacent to them into a space not adjacent to them, all three orcs get to make an opportunity attack.

Vera is toe-to-toe with two snotlings who flee in terror as she enters a berserker rage. Both snotlings trigger an opportunity attack. However, because she is limited to one opportunity attack per round, Vera can only attack one of them.

Sergeant Rage is wielding a shotgun. A ratman dashes up to him, attacks with a dagger, and then dashes away. Because Sarge doesn't have a melee weapon equipped, he does not get an opportunity attack against the ratman.

#### Sustaining Boons

Many boons have a default duration of *sustain persists*, which means that every time a character uses the **sustain** action, the boon remains in effect for 1 additional round. If you have a boon in effect and do not sustain it, the boon ends when your turn is over. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, you can normally only sustain one boon at a time, and you cannot sustain a boon on a round in which you take a focus action.

### Focus Actions

Using a focus action involves spending all of your energy and attention on one task. If you choose to forgo your major, move, and minor actions for a round, you may instead take a focus action. Choose one of the following types of focus action:

**Disrupting Attack.** Make a damaging attack using the normal attack rules. If your attack deals 10 or more points of damage, then any boons being sustained by your target immediately end.

**Superior Action.** Make any one action roll with advantage 1.

**Charge.** Move up to twice your speed and make one melee attack at disadvantage 1.

### Interrupt Actions

In some situations, you may want to take an action in response to another combatant’s action. In these cases, you can use an interrupt action. However, whenever you use an interrupt action, you lose your major action the next time your turn in the initiative order comes up. You can use your interrupt action to attempt any of the following:

**Defend.** You may use a defend action after an enemy has rolled a successful attack against you or an ally in order to attempt to ward off the attack. (Protection, Agility, and Might are all
typical examples of attributes used to defend).

If your attribute roll is higher than the targeted defense score, then your roll replaces the targeted defense score for that attack only. (**Note:** Characters wielding a shield gain advantage on defend actions when appropriate).

As part of your defend action, you may also move up to half of your speed at any time during your action. If you are adjacent to your ally when moving, the ally may choose to move with you.

**Improvise. **You may also use your interrupt action in order to improvise a response to a situation in combat. For example, if an ally falls off a cliff, you may use your interrupt action to invoke a levitate boon and save them. Improvised interrupt actions should generally be limited to non-offensive reactions meant to assist allies.

## Damage and Healing

Your hit points (HP) are an abstract measure of your character’s ability to ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. Whenever you take damage, your hit points are reduced, and whenever you receive healing they are increased.

### Reaching Zero Hit Points

When you reach zero HP, you fall unconscious. Your hit points cannot be reduced below zero. While unconscious, you are helpless and any attack made against you counts as a finishing blow. Any healing that you receive to bring your hit points above zero also causes you to regain consciousness.

### Finishing Blows

When you suffer an attack while unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to defend yourself, you must make a Fortitude roll with a Challenge Rating equal to half the damage dealt. If you fail this roll, you are dead.

### Healing After Combat

After a combat encounter ends and you have at least ten minutes to rest and catch your breath, your hit points return to their maximum if you are already conscious. If you are unconscious, you regain consciousness and all hit points after 2d4 hours.

> ### Lethal Damage (Optional Rule)
>
> GMs who want to create a grim and gritty setting can elect to use the option lethal damage rule to inflict wounds that persist beyond a combat encounter.
>
> Whenever you roll a natural 20 on the d20 used in a damaging attack roll, your attack inflicts some lethal damage. The amount of lethal damage is equal to the total of subsequent d20 rolls for that attack (i.e., the d20 explosion total). A creature’s maximum hit points are reduced by the amount of lethal damage it suffers.
>
> Lethal damage is more difficult to heal then regular damage, healing at a rate of 1 hit point per day per Fortitude attribute point (minimum of 1 hit point).  With the full-time attendance of a capable healer, any number of characters who are located in the same area and avoid strenuous activity heal at an additional rate equal to their attendant’s Creation, Presence, or Learning score.  Multiple attendants do not cumulatively improve this accelerated healing rate (the bonus is simply equal to the highest score among attendants).
>
> For example, a warrior with Fortitude 4 heals 4 lethal damage per day on his own. With the assistance of a physician with a learning score of 8, the same warrior would heal at a rate of 12 lethal damage per day.
