# Chapter 1: Character Creation #

Before you can start telling your story, you’ll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In *Open Legend*, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.

Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.

*Who were the characters you identified with?*

*Who inspired you?*

Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.

### Choose an Example Character & Modify It

For anyone who feels they could benefit from some inspiration, you can easily make a copy of any of these spreadsheets (they include formulas for doing most all of the calculations for you), and then increase or decrease attribute scores, as well as add or remove feats. Be sure to adjust the **Level** field to get the correct calculations for attribute & feat points at your current character level.

## Step 1: Describe Your Character

*Open Legend* is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear that we will learn about in later steps. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Your race.** Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.

As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your **size**: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10'x10' square in combat and has a 10' reach (see Chapter 6: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.

At the GM's discretion, you may choose to be even smaller or larger than the sizes described above. A large creature's reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15'x15' base would have a 15' reach. Small creatures always have at least a 5' reach.

> ### No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?
> In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in the a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing the aforementioned psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the *scent* perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the *observant* perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the *hot tempered* flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits.** Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign.

> ### Example Character Secrets
> Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.
>
> * * * * *
>
> Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child--that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.
>
> * * * * *
>
> Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive > with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, physically and mentally.


## Step 2: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in *Open Legend*. They define what your character can and can’t do--the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In *Open Legend*, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and extraordinary.

A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero.

The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.

In *Open Legend*, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| ATTRIBUTE QUICK BUILDS |
| - |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 |


### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don’t have to spend all of your points at character creation.

<div class="table-no-body table-centered"></div>
| PURCHASING ATTRIBUTES |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Cost |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Archetype Build
In the Archetype Attribute Builds table, several common fantasy archetypes are listed. If you are envisioning a character similar to one of these, you can just take one of these sets as written, or swap out some of the attributes for others.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| ARCHETYPE ATTRIBUTE BUILDS |

| Entropy 3 | Creation 2 | Will 2  |
| Movement 3 | Influence 4 | Movement 3  |
| | | Protection 5 |


### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Dice |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |

<br><br>

> ### Roll Them Bones
> If you are new to gaming, you may not be familiar with dice notation, such as 2d6.
>
> As you play Open Legend, you’ll often need to roll dice to determine the outcome of actions. **Dice notation** is a shorthand way of indicating which dice to roll.
>
> Every die roll is indicated by a formula such as 3d6. The number before the *d* indicates how many dice to roll, and the number after the *d* indicates how many sides those dice have.
>
> So, 3d6 means that you roll three six-sided dice.
>
> 4d4 indicates four four-sided dice.
>
> And so on.

<br><br>

## Step 3: Record Defenses, Hit Points, and Speed

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with the shot of a rifle, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will |
| - |
| |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability. For example, foes attempting to poison you, drain your life force, or push you off a cliff will target your toughness.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Guard = 10 + Agility + Might + Armor |
| - |
| |

**Guard** protects you from attacks that can either be dodged, deflected, or directly withstood via raw physical power. Your enemies would need to overcome your guard in order to hit you with a grenade, shoot you with an arrow, or smash you with a maul.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |
| - |
| |

**Resolve** represents your character’s ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |
| - |
| |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

**Speed** indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 6: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.

## Step 4: Purchase Feats

While your character’s attributes define his skill at accomplishing
heroic tasks, his **feats** are what make him unique among other
characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him
the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so they take the *Combat Momentum* feat to allow them to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes *Battle Trance* so that they can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate their foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat
points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable list
[*here*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats).

If your character is based on a specific archetype, you may want to
start with the feat selections recommended below:

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Archetype Feat Recommendations |
| - |

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Barbarian | Ranger | Monk |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Battle Trance | Master Tracker | Multi-target Attack Specialist 1 (melee) |
| Reckless Frenzy | Fleet of Foot 1 | Martial Focus (Unarmed) |
| | Attack Specialization 1 (Longbow) | Combat Momentum |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Paladin | Battle Mage | Mind Mage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Attribute Substitution 2 (Presence > Might)  | Attack Specialization 1 (Cold) | Hallucination |

| :- | :- | :- |
| Lethal Strike 1 | Boon Focus 1 (Bolster) | Defensive Reflexes 1 |
| Boon Focus 1 (Teleport) | Boon Focus 1 (Heal) | Boon Focus 1 (Teleport) |

<br><br>

## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of *Open Legend*, your character will start with the gear they need for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.

Instead of purchasing equipment a la carte, you may also elect to choose one of the following starting packages built for common character archetypes. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Archetype Starting Packages |
| - |

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Barbarian | Ranger | Monk |
| :- | :- | :- |

| Hand Crossbow | Longsword | Dagger |
| Leather Armor | Leather Armor | Leather Armor |
| Rogue’s Pack | Adventurer’s Pack | Mage’s Pack |

## Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws
In addition to the descriptive details you have just created, you may also choose up to two perks and up to two flaws from the following lists.

Perks are characteristics that describe very specific skills, attitudes, backgrounds, or opportunities that tend to give your character the upper hand in certain situations. For example, maybe you are a noble and thus able to draw favors from powerful political figures, or perhaps you once served as mechanic on a starship and those technical skills still help you out in your adventuring life today.

Flaws are your Achilles’ heel. They are weaknesses that your enemies can exploit or character deficits that always seem to hold you back at just the wrong moment. Maybe you are stubborn as a mule and won’t accept a compromise under any circumstances. Perhaps your greed tends to get the best of you, and your love of coin will even trump your loyalty to your friends. Your flaws might even be physical in nature: you’re blind, missing an arm, or suffer from a wounded knee that slows you down.


### Activating Perks

Perks provide very specific bonuses or effects in specific situations. Your perk description will explain exactly what your perk does and how often it can be activated. Some perks can be used whenever the situation merits while others are more limited. If the use of a perk relies on a situation being relevant to the sphere of influence of the perk, the GM has the final say as to whether the perk applies or not. For example, the *profession* perk provides advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls related to your chosen profession. If a character wants to use their *profession: hunter* perk to gain advantage on a roll to track an orc, the GM would decide whether or not the PC’s experience tracking game was relevant enough to aid in the hunt for a humanoid.

### Activating Flaws

While perks provide specific benefits according to their descriptions, flaws are actively used by players to hinder the actions of their characters. You would do this for two primary reasons: first, to add depth and variety to your character and the story; and, second, to earn legend points, which can be used to enhance your chances of success on a future action (see Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes). In this way, flaws and legend points provide a sort of karmic balance to one another. Your sacrifice in one situation is rewarded in the future.

You may not gain a legend point from the same flaw more than once per game session. Furthermore, you are in complete control of how and when your own flaws affect you. For example, you might play a blind samurai (using the *disabled* flaw) who has such heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch that they're usually completely unaffected by their blindness. Only under extreme circumstances does the blindness hinder them.

To activate a flaw, you should intentionally make a disadvantageous choice based on your flaw that creates an interesting or tense moment in the plot. When you do so, let your GM know that you are activating your flaw and describe how it is hindering your efforts or influencing your decisions. If the GM approves that your flaw is creating a significant disadvantage and advancing the story, you receive one legend point. Sometimes, the GM may recognize that you are roleplaying a flaw without you having to overtly activate it. In such cases, the GM may award you with a legend point as well.

The type of hindrance caused by activating a flaw should be more than a simple reduced chance of success. Good examples of activating a flaw include putting yourself or an ally in danger, making a bad decision, wasting a resource, and missing out on an opportunity, among others. It’s also important to note that a good use of a flaw makes something new and interesting happen in the story rather than ending the narrative. For example, instead of activating a flaw to miss an attack, you might target an ally. Or, rather than activating a flaw to fail to find a secret door, you might make so much noise in your search that you attract unwanted attention.

> ### Examples of Activating Flaws
> Oxnar the Barbarian was never known for his brains, so when the pixie promised him that eating the golden mushroom would make him as strong as a hundred mules, he gobbled it up with no questions and much gusto. A minute later he was dozing in a puddle of his own drool as the imp made off with his coin purse. The GM awards Oxnar with a legend point for effectively roleplaying his *dimwitted* flaw to his own detriment.
>
> * * * * *
>
> Normally, Celeste’s blindness from the *disabled* flaw doesn’t stop her from being one of the best shots in the Badlands. Her keen hearing and extrasensory perception more than make up for her lack of sight. The unearthly wailing of these zombie shriekers, however, have overwhelmed her senses. The player who is role-playing Celeste decides that the situation is dicey enough that she will unintentionally target one of her allies. She lets the GM know that she is specifically activating her disabled flaw, and the GM agrees that the impact is significant enough to merit a legend point for adding a new level of depth and realism to the story the group is telling together.
>
> * * * * *
>
> The psion Madrina has the *ambitious* flaw. After rescuing a group of mining colony civilians from a catastrophic air lock breach, Madrina is given the chance to ask a reward of the Chancellor. Madrina asks for the hand of the Chancellor's eldest in marriage, rather than a more reasonable request such as currency or similar. The Chancellor becomes infuriated, but the GM awards a legend point for role-playing a flaw in a way that furthers the story.

### Gaining Perks and Flaws

At character creation, you may select up to two perks and two flaws, and you do not have to select any. Throughout your adventures, the GM may assign you additional perks and flaws as the natural results of your deeds. For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the *profession: sailor* perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the *physical deformity* flaw to describe your scarred face.

You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM’s approval as your character’s personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the *cowardly* flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the *artisan* perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws.

### Designing Your Own Perks and Flaws

The lists provided here are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.

Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.

Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the *artisan* perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the *attractive* perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the *idol* perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.

### Perk List

#### Ageless

Whether you are an android constructed of spaceage material that does not erode over time, the loyal servant of a higher power, or the subject of an arcane ritual, you have unlocked the secret to immortality. You are immune to the passage of time and the effects of old age. Your body does not age and you cannot be harmed by extraordinary effects that cause aging. Based on the source of your agelessness, you can decide whether or not your appearance changes over time.

#### Arcane Bloodline

Your ancestry can be traced to dragons, fey, or a similarly magical race. As such, you command the respect of those who practice the arcane arts. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the ways of magic, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you an apprenticeship with a famous Archmage, or cause a magic-user who does not know you well to follow a prescribed course of action based on your advice if the question is one of Arcane knowledge.

#### Artisan

Choose a specific craft, such as weapon smithing, glass blowing, or brewing. You know the ins and outs of crafting goods of the highest quality within your chosen specialty. As a master craftsman, you are able to create items of exceptional value given the necessary time and materials. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your crafting skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.

#### Ascetic

You are well-versed in the art of living with less. Whether a cloistered monk or a wizened sage who spent years locked away in a tower of books, you are experienced at going long stretches of time with very little food, water, or company - and as such, these situations tend not to affect you as they do others. You are hardened against physical and mental deprivation and have developed an enviable degree of self-mastery.

#### Attractive

You are just really darn good looking. This plays to your favor more than just romantically, and your good looks tend to help you out in all sorts of social situations. Whenever your attractiveness would play a role in a situation, you gain advantage 1 to any relevant action rolls.

#### Brute

While others might convince with a silver tongue, you speak the universal language of fear. Once per game session, if you make a show of physical force, you can use your *Might* attribute for a *Persuasion* roll. If your *Persuasion* score is already equal to or greater than your *Might* score, you get advantage 1 on the roll.

#### Courageous

Your heart is brave beyond bounds. Once per game session, as a free action you can cancel all negative effects upon you related to fear or low morale.

#### Crowd Favorite

Whether you are an actor, musician, storyteller, magician, or some other type of performer, the common folk love your work. They adore you for your ability to use your art to transport them to a world beyond their daily drudgery, and you can always find a place to perform and make money at the local tavern or inn.


#### Divine Agent

You serve a higher being and have earned their protection. Once per game session, when you are subject to a *Finishing Blow* while your hit points are below 1, you automatically heal to a hit point total of 1.

#### Divine Insight

You possess a supernatural connection to a deity, demi-god, or other divine being which grants you otherworldly insight. Once per game session, you can choose a topic relevant to the story. The GM shares some information about that topic which might be useful. If you’ve just failed a *Learning* attribute roll and use this ability, the GM decides whether to give you information related to that roll or to give you knowledge that is completely unrelated.

#### Ear of the Emperor

You have done something in the past to earn the favor of someone in a high place: a senator, the general of an army, a merchant lord, etc. Perhaps you saved their life or spared them from significant monetary loss. Whatever you did, they owe you, and they are willing to help you with minor favors as long as the favors do not subject them to any risk or cost. Once during the campaign, you can call in a large favor that does put your contact in risk or cost them something significant. They will perform the favor, but you immediately lose this trait, as their debt has been repaid.

#### Idol

Your reputation for some outstanding virtue precedes you, and people tend to hold you in high esteem. Once per session, you can call upon your reputation to inspire trust from someone who is skeptical of you, your actions, or your allies.

#### Inner Strength

Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a Fortitude action roll of Challenge Rating less than or equal to 10 + twice your Fortitude score.

#### Innocent

Whether from a distant fey ancestry or simply an air of naivety, you possess a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts. Once per game session, you can leverage your innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you’ve done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.

#### Jack of All Trades

You have a knack for picking up new skills. Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided its Challenge Rating is less than or equal to 14.

#### Local Hero

You are well-known and respected as a protector of the common folk in a small region. The commoners look up to you, and will offer you food, shelter, and other necessities. They will even take risks or assume minor costs to aid or protect you, so long as the risk is not death.

#### Lucky

Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck shine to upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling boulder, or a town guardsman decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.

#### Merchant

You know the art of economics as well as the best of businessmen. A master of supply and demand, you have a knack for knowing when to buy and when to sell. You cannot be swindled when it comes to bartering, and you always know whether or not you are getting a fair price. Furthermore, you have friends in merchant circles and guilds in your home city, and you can easily gain them in new locations.

#### Noble

Being of high birth, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by lesser nobles and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.

#### Observant

Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing. If you use this ability after failing a *Perception* roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.

#### Outlaw

You are part of a criminal network, whether it be a thieves’ guild, band of smugglers, or otherwise. Once per game session, you can call in a favor from a contact within your network to perform a mundane task such as gathering information or arranging safe passage. If the favor puts your contact at risk, they will still perform it but may ask for an equally risky favor from you in return.

#### Profession

Choose a specific trade, such as sailor, soldier, or miner. You know everything there is to know about the business and are a master of the requisite skills. A sailor, for example, can tie a knot for all occasions, navigate by the stars, and man any station aboard a ship. A soldier is well-versed in a variety of arms, understands military tactics, and knows how to navigate the chain of command with ease. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your professional skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.

#### Pure-hearted

Any goodly-natured creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral. Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you’ve taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.

#### Scavenger

You have lived a life of need, and thus know how to make do when others would go without. Once per game session, you can easily acquire a single mundane item even though it would otherwise take time to get or be completely unattainable. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may decide that your acquisition is only temporary or subject to reasonable conditions. For example, you might use this perk to acquire a rope in the middle of a desert, but the GM may rule that it is so sun-baked and ancient that it will likely snap after a few uses.

#### Scent

Your sense of smell is similar to that of a wild beast. As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60’. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60’. Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 on attempts to track a creature if it has left a scent trail.

#### Scholar

You have spent years studying a particular discipline, such as science, herbalism, dragon lore, history, politics, or religion. Once per session, you can re-roll a failed *Learning* check related to your discipline, gaining advantage 2 on the re-roll. Furthermore, you have colleagues and connections within your discipline, and know the proper channels for gaining access to specialty laboratories, libraries, temples, or other collections of lore related to your field of scholarship.

#### Silver Tongue

You have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM’s choosing about the creature.

#### Stone Sense

While underground you may fail to find what you’re looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered. Furthermore, you have advantage 1 on any action rolls in which a familiarity with underground environments would prove helpful, such as attempts to identify the risk of a cave in or to find a secret passage within a cavern.

#### Street Rat

You were raised on the streets or at least spent a good deal of time crawling about them. As such, you know how to navigate urban areas quickly, make yourself unseen, and find a bite to eat when you’re down on your luck. As one of the invisible urchins that crawl the city, you are also quite adept at picking up rumors in taverns and crowded streets.

#### Extraordinary Presence

Your inherent extraordinary nature manifests itself in a tangible way of your choosing. For example, your eyes may glow, your skin might emanate an icy chill, or a trail of withering plants could follow you wherever you set foot. Depending on the nature of your extraordinary presence, it might make others more likely to fear, admire, or trust you--or otherwise alter their initial perceptions of you. Whenever your extraordinary presence is relevant in a social situation, you gain advantage 1 on any action rolls you make.

#### Sylvan Ally

Creatures of nature can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals give you a wide berth, Druids give you the benefit of a doubt by assuming that you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with the chief of a small local tribe by virtue of your reputation for defending nature.

#### Vagabond

Having spent significant time fending for yourself in the wilderness, you excel at surviving and navigating in the wild. You always know the direction of true north and you can automatically find enough food to feed yourself plus a number of additional people equal to your Learning attribute score.

#### Warrior’s Code

As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this ability to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.

#### Whisperer of the Wild

Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.


### Flaw List

#### Absent-minded

Your live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters. Whatever the source of your absent-mindedness, you are slow to notice important details and have a tendency to get distracted at exactly the worst possible moment.

#### Addiction

The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you’ve got an itch that you need to scratch, and you’ll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix. You get to decide the nature and severity of your addiction.

#### Ambitious

You are willing to do anything to get ahead in life and often that means trampling upon other people on your way to the top. When presented with a situation requiring empathy for those beneath you, it’s typical for you to ignore their need. In addition, you may sometimes overreach in your attempts to get ahead, making bold and risky choices that can put you and those close to you in danger.

#### Bloodlust

Battle isn’t just a way of life, it is *the* way of life. There isn’t a conflict you’ve encountered that wasn’t best solved with steel, and your allies will have a hard time convincing you otherwise. You are prone to starting fights when they aren’t necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered.


#### Brash

You are bold and daring to the point of recklessness. You have no time for plans, calculations, or strategic thinking. A lot of brass and a peck of luck are all you need. Kick in the door and let the details sort themselves out.

#### Bravado

You have a flair for the dramatic, and will often undertake bold or daring maneuvers simply for the thrill of it. For example, in combat you might swing from a chandelier even if it offers no tactical advantage.

#### Cosmetic Deformity

Something about you makes you less attractive, undesirable to behold, or even just downright abominable. You get to decide the nature and severity of your deformity. Examples include a scarred cheek, vacant white eyes, a burn-covered body, and a missing nose. Whatever form this flaw takes, it is merely cosmetic and thus will generally only affect you in social situations.

#### Compulsion

You have an irresistible urge to perform a behavior of your choice. Examples include, grinding your teeth, tapping your foot, biting your fingernails, counting coinage, and washing your hands. Your compulsion can sometimes put you in awkward or embarrassing situations, such as needing to wash your hands immediately after shaking hands with an ambassador.

#### Cowardly

You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harms way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot.

#### Dimwitted

You aren’t the sharpest tack in the box. It’s not just that you weren’t gifted with skill in academia, it’s that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall. With the exception of your areas of expertise, you have a hard time learning new skills, following instructions, and maybe even remembering names.

#### Disabled

You have some physical deficiency that holds you back in life. You decide the nature and severity of your disability. Some examples of disabilities include blindness, deafness, missing limbs, partial paralysis, bone deficiencies, or allergies.

#### Greedy

You can’t help it: you just like things. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you’ll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You’re easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.

#### Honest

You won’t tell a lie or engage in deceitful speech, even to save your own life or the life of another.

#### Hot Tempered
Your fuse is short and your explosions are destructive. Sometimes your anger boils slowly over time and other times it erupts completely unexpectedly. But when you do fly off the handle, things rarely go well for you.

#### Illiterate

You can’t read or write, even in languages that you speak fluently.

#### Literal Minded

You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is “raining cats and dogs”. If a friend exaggerated by saying “I’d kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice”, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend’s life if Melzak did get elected.

#### Mood Disorder

You suffer from a psychological condition that directly affects your mood, such as depression or anxiety. You get to to determine the nature and severity of your mood disorder.

#### Naive

Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you’re a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.

#### Overt

You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.

#### Overweight

You are carrying a few extra pounds, and they tend to get in the way at all the wrong times, such as when climbing a ladder or crossing a decrepit rope bridge.

#### Pacifist

You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism. You might just revert to violence as a last resort, or you may be so averse to combat that you won’t lift a weapon even in defense of yourself or others.

#### Phobia

You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence, a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.

#### Proud

Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you’re not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Star Force leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.

#### Psychotic

You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality. You get to determine the extent and nature of your psychosis, including any potential triggers. For example, you might believe that beings from another dimension are trying to abduct you, or perhaps you relive a nightmarish scene from your past whenever you are in the midst of a gun fight.

#### Short-winded

You have poor lung capacity and easily tire. Sprints, long runs, and forced marches are either impossible for you or they tend to leave you completely incapacitated afterwards.

#### Sick

You suffer from some sort of chronic illness or condition, such as tuberculosis, cancer, arthritis, or irritable bowel syndrome. Even if you possess the means to treat your disease or control the symptoms, you might still have episodes or flare ups that hinder your adventuring life.

#### Socially Awkward

Something about your behavior tends to rub people the wrong way. Perhaps you don’t respect the personal space of others, you tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details. Whatever the nature of your awkwardness, it makes social situations difficult for you at times.

#### Stubborn
It’s your way or the highway. Maybe not all of the time, but once you’ve made your mind up on an important matter, you won’t budge. You probably won’t even compromise.

#### Uncoordinated

Your body just doesn’t work well with itself. You have trouble balancing, catching, throwing, and performing similar physical tasks that require dexterity or nimbleness.

#### Vengeful

You let no slight go unpunished. While some might be able to shake off an insult from a tavern drunk, you take it as a personal assault that demands satisfaction. The more severe the crime, the greater the vengeance you will mete out.

#### Zealous

You stand for a cause - whether it is a religion, a nation, a code, a way of life, or otherwise - and you will push the boundaries of normal behavior to uphold your cause. This might mean that you make yourself a social outcast by attempting to convert others to your cause, or it could mean that you are willing to perform an act you might otherwise consider evil, such as putting innocent lives in danger, if doing so would promote your cause.


### Tell Your Story

With your character created, you are all ready to start playing *Open Legend*. Whether you’re playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you’re completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.

### Relax

*Open Legend* gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels--but whatever you do, shake the dice like your life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.

### Respect the GM

If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of the game.

### Respect the Other Players

Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing *Open Legend*, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM’s duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever
that means for them.

## Gaining XP and Leveling Up

As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.

Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters, NPCs, and monsters. Until you reach 5th level, the maximum attribute score is 5. From levels 6 to 9, the maximum is equal to your level.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Player Character Level Advancement |
| - |
| |

<br>

| Total XP | Level | Maximum Attribute Score |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 5 |
| 9 | 4 | 5 |
| 12 | 5 | 5 |
| 15 | 6 | 6 |
| 18 | 7 | 7 |
| 21 | 8 | 8 |
| 24 | 9 | 9 |
| 27 | 10 | 9 |

### Feat and Attribute Points

For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points *every* time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.

Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.

See [*Feats*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats) to view the complete list of feats to choose from.

| 7 | 28 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 36 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 45 | 3d10 |
| 10 | - | 4d8 |

**Note:** An attribute score of 10 cannot be purchased with attribute points. It can only be obtained through feats, boons, or other special means. No attribute may advance beyond a score of 10.

### New Hit Points

In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.
