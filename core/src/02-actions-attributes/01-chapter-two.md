# Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes #

The Introduction and Chapter 1 provided you with the core mechanic for action resolution as well as a brief overview of what the different attributes are used for. This chapter will delve a little bit deeper, explaining when to make different types of action rolls and how to
interpret the results.

## When to Roll the Dice

*Open Legend* is about creating great stories full of epic moments of heroism, and you roll dice to determine the outcome of those moments. In short, you only need to make action rolls when the outcome of the intended action plays a significant role in the story. In combat, for
example, you’ll be making plenty of action rolls to clash blades, sling spells, and leap over treacherous chasms. But you don’t need to roll a Persuasion check every time you go to buy something from the bazaar, and you don’t need to roll Logic to remember where you left the key to your room at the inn.

## Every Roll Matters

Another important point in *Open Legend* is that every action roll should drive the story in a new direction, for better or worse. A failed roll should not let the story stagnate, nor should a failure be easily negated by a successful roll from another character.

If you look back to the Core Mechanic, you can see that a simple failure is not an option:

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| The Action Roll  |
| - |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

<br />

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> **- OR -** <br /> the player fails, but the story progresses. <br />*(GM’s Choice)* |

Here’s an example to illustrate how to make every roll matter.

*Pelias Quickenfit, a halfling burglar, is attempting to pick the lock on a door. He rolls an Agility check but gets lower than the challenge rating.*

### What NOT to do

In this case, what might often happen at a gaming table is that upon seeing the halfling’s failure, another character immediately steps forward, say the barbarian, and attempts to force the door down. In *Open Legend*, such a reaction is frowned upon because it would mean that the burglar’s roll didn’t matter. It didn’t drive the story at all. Instead, the barbarian should wait for the GM to interpret the result of Pelias’s roll. Here are two potential outcomes for the roll:

*If the GM chooses **success with a twist**, he might rule that Pelias is able to open the lock; however, just as he finishes the job, he begins to hear a faint hissing sound from the door. A poison gas trap! The burglar immediately falls unconscious, and the rest of the party must decide what to do before the gas reaches them in a matter of seconds.*

*If the GM chooses **failure, but the story progresses**, he might rule that although Pelias is unable to get the lock open, he hears footsteps approaching from around the corner accompanied by the familiar jingle of a jailer’s keychain. If the party can position themselves quickly enough, they may be able to get the keys without a fight.*

Notice how both of these options allow Pelias’s action to drive the story forward just as much as a successful roll would have. In the second example, perhaps the barbarian still ends up bashing the door down with brute force, but at least the story moved on in some way because of the burglar’s attempts.

The GM has a right to interpret the results of a failed action roll so that he can ensure that every roll matters. Players should make a special effort to avoid stepping on the GM’s toes in this regard.


> ### Old Habits Die Hard
> If you’ve played other RPGs in the past, you may be tempted to immediately follow another player’s failed roll with an action roll of your own.
>
> The following are common situations in which you should be especially vigilant to give the GM time to interpret the results of a failed action roll:
>
> * Perception rolls to find secret doors or other hidden objects
> * Perception rolls to notice when someone is lying
> * Persuasion rolls to convince an NPC of something
> * Learning rolls to recall useful information

### Keep It Simple: Every Roll Matters for the GM

The “every roll matters” rule was designed to make player actions meaningful to the story whether they succeed or fail. It recognizes the fact that static pass/fail checks aren’t particularly fun for players. But “every roll matters” also adds an extra layer of complexity to the game because it requires the GM to make on-the-fly interpretations.

**So when the GM makes a roll**, a success is a success and a failure is a failure.

This is for the sake of simplicity and fun. When a player fails a roll, it’s not very fun if something doesn’t come out of it. When the GM fails a roll, though, there is usually much rejoicing at the table.

## Interpreting Action Rolls

The previous example provides just one method in which a GM might interpret the results of an action roll, but there is a little more to it than that. In this section, you’ll get some empowering guidelines to help everyone at the table feel comfortable with the amount of improvisation required for *Open Legend*.

### Interpreting Success

A successful action roll is by far the easiest to interpret: it means that the player gets what she was hoping for. If she was rolling to climb a cliff, then she climbs it. If she was trying to pick a pocket, then it’s picked. If she was trying to stab an orc, he’s stabbed. And so on.

In some cases, the results of a success are already written into the rules (such as in combat, explained in Chapter 6). Often, though, the GM will need to determine what happens with a successful action roll.

There are two primary factors to consider when adjudicating a success:

**Don’t roll if there’s nothing to succeed at.** For example, if a character wants to search a corridor for secret passages, but the GM knows there aren’t any, he doesn’t need to have the character roll a Perception check, because there’s nothing to find. The roll doesn’t matter.

**Describe your success.** Whenever the situation allows, the player should show the rest of the table what success looks like. It’s his turn in the spotlight, so let him shine. If your rogue successfully disarms a trap, describe how the scything blade just barely nicked your cheek before you finished the job. If your barbarian makes a successful leap attack against the orc chieftain, narrate how you knock his shield aside with your first blow before coming down on his skull with your axe. Sometimes, of course, the GM has privileged information, so she needs to be the one to describe things. Whenever possible, though, the players should describe their own success.

### Interpreting Success with a Twist

When a player fails an action roll, the GM may choose to allow the player’s action to succeed with a twist. In this case, the player gets what they wanted originally, but there is some sort of unintended consequence or unexpected cost. The following list is not exhaustive, but it should give you a pretty good idea of what qualifies as a twist.

- **Put a character in danger**
- **Expend a resource**
- **Make an enemy or lose a friend**
- **Overlook an important detail**
- **Waste time**
- **Attract attention**
- **Find something you weren’t looking for**

The important thing to realize is that a success with a twist is still a success. It just comes at some sort of a cost: You find the trail of the hydra you’re tracking, but it leads you through a swamp infested with undead. You sense that the merchant is overcharging you, but you fail to realize that he’s also distracting you from the thugs sneaking up behind you. You are able to hit the wyvern with your bow, but it costs you your last arrow.

### Interpreting Failure, but the Story Progresses

In *Open Legend*, a failure is never just a failure, it’s always an important element in the story, hence the rule that “the story progresses”.

Progress, though, can mean a lot of things. When the GM selects this option, the following interpretations should give you some idea of how the story can progress in spite of failure.

**The player finds an opportunity for success.** Even though your magic fails to dispel the curse afflicting your ally, you discover during later study that a rare herb growing in a nearby forest would give you the power you require.

**The danger snowballs.** You fail to jump a chasm while fleeing a band of cannibals. You fall along the cliffside, taking some damage. When you gather your senses, you realize that you aren’t only separated from the rest of your party, but you’ve also fallen into the nest of a Roc.

**The information is false.** You think you’ve got a good read on the mayor during your negotiations. It seems like he’s completely in favor of your plan to negotiate an alliance with the neighboring dwarves. When you set out the next day, however, it turns out you were wrong, and the guards he sent to ensure your safe passage turn out to be your assassins.

The GM gets to decide how bad a failed action roll turns out to be, and sometimes, it’s really bad. While some of these examples are harsher than others, they all share one common factor: they steer the narrative forward. Failure is never just a failure.

## Determining Challenge Rating

Many actions that you will undertake in *Open Legend* have a Challenge Rating (CR) that is determined by the rules. Attacks in combat, for example, use one of the target’s defense scores as the CR.

Oftentimes, though, the GM will need to determine the CR for actions that aren’t spelled out clearly in the rules. In these cases, the GM can use the Challenge Ratings by Difficulty Table to set an appropriate CR.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Challenge Ratings by Difficulty |
| - |
| |

| Difficulty | Challenge Rating | Example Actions |
| :-: | :-: | :------ |
| Everyday | 10 | leap a 5’ gap, climb a surface with ledges, break down a household door, haggle a simple merchant for a discount |
| Challenging | 15 | climb a rough surface, catch the drift of a text in an unfamiliar language, break down a strong wooden door |
| Very Hard | 20 | climb a smooth surface, leap a 15’ gap, translate a text in an unfamiliar language, convince a neutral party to take a risk for you |
| Heroic | 25 | translate a text in an alien language, break down an iron door |
| Legendary | 30 | leap a 25’ chasm, climb a flat surface, befriend an enemy with a vendetta against you |

It’s important to note that Challenge Ratings are not typically set to be relative to the party’s level. So, breaking down a strong wooden door is CR 15 whether the party is first level or tenth.

### Contested Actions

Sometimes, two or more characters are directly opposing each other in a test of strength, wits, or charm. For example, a mighty barbarian wrestles with a minotaur to get hold of a magical gem. Or three representatives of different kingdoms attempt to persuade the outlander chieftain to join their forces. Or a stealthy rogue attempts to sneak unseen past the watch of the town guard. These sorts of situations are called **contested actions**.

To resolve such contests, each character involved makes an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Whoever rolls the highest succeeds at the action. Sometimes, all parties use the same attribute for their action rolls, but often, each character will use a different attribute, as in the case of the rogue attempting to sneak (Agility) past the guard’s watch (Perception).

> #### Example Contested Action
>
> As the Unnamed Necromancer attempts to open a portal to release a shade demon upon the land, the Uldric the Protector attempts to exert every ounce of his magical will to close the portal. The GM calls for a contested action between the two. The Necromancer makes an Entropy roll and gets a 25, while Uldric gets a 20 on his Protection roll. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, the demon has been unleashed.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes, you will attempt an action under circumstances that give you a significant upper hand, such as when attacking an enemy from behind. Other times, you’ll be working against exceptional hindrances, such as when trying to climb a rope that an enemy has covered in grease. In these types of cases, instead of adjusting the Challenge Rating of the task, the GM should assign your roll either **advantage** or **disadvantage**.

Advantage and disadvantage are always expressed with a numeric level, such as “advantage 1” or “disadvantage 3”. Multiple instances of advantage and disadvantage can add together, so if you have advantage 1 on an attack because you are flanking a foe, and you also possess a feat that grants you advantage 1, you have a total of advantage 2.

If a situation arises in which you are assigned both advantage and disadvantage, find the difference between the two values to determine your final outcome. For example, if you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 1, they negate each other and thus your action roll is normal. If you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 2, your action roll would be made with disadvantage 1.

### Effects of Advantage and Disadvantage

When you have advantage on an action, roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your advantage level. Then, when adding your dice together, ignore the lowest *X* attribute dice, in which *X* is your advantage level.

> #### Example of Advantage
>
> Vera leaps down upon her foe from a ledge ten feet above. The GM rules that she gains advantage 1 on the attack. Her Might score is 9, granting her 3d10 for attribute dice. The advantage 1 allows her to roll 1 extra d10. So she rolls 1d20 + 4d10. After rolling, but before calculating her total, she removes the lowest rolling d10.

Disadvantage works in a similar manner. When you have disadvantage, you still roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your disadvantage value. However, instead of ignoring the lowest dice, you ignore the *highest* dice.

> #### Example of Disadvantage
>
> Therilas attempts to invoke his elemental magic to call a lightning bolt down from a foe. However, he is currently being distracted by a swarm of wasps summoned by an enemy spellcaster, granting him disadvantage 1. Furthermore, he has also been subject to the fatigue bane, adding on an additional disadvantage 1. Therilas’s Energy score is 5, granting him 2d6 attribute dice. He rolls 1d20 + 4d6. After rolling, but before calculating his total, he removes the two highest rolling d6s.

### Advantage and Disadvantage Are Only Applied BEFORE Explosions

Advantage and Disadvantage only apply to your initial pool of dice for an action roll. They do not apply to subsequent rolls granted by exploding dice. 

> #### Example of Advantage with Exploding Dice
> Imagine you have attribute score 4 and are rolling with advantage 2, you would roll 1d20 + 3d8 and keep the single highest of the d8s before rolling any exploding dice. Imagine your d20 rolls a 10 and your d8s land on 8, 8, and 3. You would then keep one of the 8s and discard the other two dice. Because the 8 rolled max, you may roll it again and add the result to your total. Imagine that lands on a 5. Your total score is 23 (10 + 8 + 5).

### Advantage and Disadvantage with Attribute Scores of Zero

When attempting an action with an attribute score of zero you roll 2 d20 and keep the higher die for advantage or the lower die for disadvantage, you cannot accrue advantage or disadvantage greater than 1. Your character is already so inept at the action that he cannot capitalize on cumulative circumstancial help or hindrances.

### Assigning Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and disadvantage can be assigned by the GM due to situational effects, or they can be assigned by feats, banes, and boons. When assigned situationally, the GM should never apply more than one level of advantage or disadvantage. Feats, banes, and boons--on the other hand--will often provide multiple levels as they rise in tier or power level. The Advantage and Disadvantage Examples Tables provides a listing of typical situations in which the GM may assign advantage and disadvantage, though this list is by no means exhaustive.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Advantage and Disadvantage Examples |
| - |
| |

| Situations Meriting Advantage | Situations Meriting Disadvantage |
| :- | :- |
| Attacking a surprised or unaware foe | Attacking while balancing on a beam |
| Attacking a foe during an acrobatic stunt | Attacking in a confined space |
| Negotiating with someone you have leverage over | Negotiating with someone who has leverage over you |
| Expending a valuable arcane focus when casting a spell | Casting a spell in the midst of a heavy storm |
| Conducting research in a well-stocked library | Conducting research while sick |
| Tracking a large group | Tracking a creature smaller than a child |


The Average Challenge Ratings vs. Attribute Scores Table lists Challenge Ratings that are of average difficulty for a character with specific attribute scores. A character with the listed attribute can be expected to succeed at the listed Challenge Rating close to **50%** of the time.

## Legend Points

An additional layer of depth to action resolution comes in the form of legend points, which allow players an opportunity to stack the dice when it comes time to perform a particularly legendary action.

Characters begin play with zero legend points, and the maximum they may acquire is 10. The GM may reward a PC with a legend point when they use one of their flaws to their own disadvantage or for particularly strong roleplaying (see Chapter 1: Character Creation).

> ### Example of Earning a Legend Point
> 
> Zaax has the *hot tempered* flaw, causing him to easily lose control of his anger. In the middle of the party’s tense negotiations with the Imperial Guard, Zaax loses his patience with the high commander and shoots one of the guardsmen. This is a clear example of Zaax roleplaying his flaw despite negative consequences, so the GM awards him with a legend point.

The GM may also feel free to establish other rules for awarding legend points. For example, some GMs like to allow each player to award another PC one legend point each session. Other tables might have a vote for MVP or best roleplayer at the end of each session, with the winner gaining a legend point.

### Spending Legend Points

Before making an action roll, a PC may spend a maximum number of legend points equal to their level plus one. For each legend point spent, they gain advantage 1 on the action roll.
