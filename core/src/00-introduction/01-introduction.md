# Introduction: This is Your Story. Tell it. #

*Deep in the bowels of a long forgotten tomb, a pair of treasure seekers huddle around a dusty sarcophagus. One of them, robed in crimson, works to decipher the eldritch runes etched upon the ancient coffin.*

*“Hold that torch steady!” he mutters to his companion.*

*But his whispers carry far in the deep tunnels of the Pyramid of Amon Ket, and soon the echoes are like a siren in the darkness. Pairs of red eyes awaken at the edge of the torchlight, fires of malice that burn for the souls of the intruders. “Therilas,” stutters the torchbearer as he draws a shining blade, “I think you’ve disturbed their sleep.”*

*The death throes of the orcs can be heard two realms over as they fall in waves to the heroes making their last stand upon the Ruins of Ravenwatch. Still, there is no end in sight to the horde that blackens the hills like a swarm of locusts.*

*“They come for the Stone,” grunts a dwarf, pulling his axe from the skull of another pig-headed orc. “Just give it to them, and maybe we’ll get out of this alive.”*

*It is an elven maiden, tall and clad in battleworn mail, who replies: “I’ll have no bard sing tales of Gwynilith the Cowardly, who surrendered to orc scum while still she drew breath.”*

*As elf and dwarf bicker, a grey haired man, cloaked in emerald, stands tall atop a boulder at the center of the ruins. His eyes stare distantly, like sharp daggers, at the golden sun landing upon the horizon. With a smirk, he raises his gnarled oaken staff to the sky,
where the gathering storm clouds crackle with the fury of nature’s electric potential. “Gentleman, lady…” speaks the druid with soft confidence, “I think the winds have turned in our favor.”*

> ### Why Open Legend?
If you have played roleplaying games in the past, you may be wondering What makes Open Legend worth my time? What makes it different?
>
>The secret’s in the title: Open. Everything about the game is about opening up the doors of possibility so that every table tells a legend worth telling. Here are a few of the possibilities that Open Legend offers.
>
>**Open Source**. That’s right. The core rules are released under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY). We know the public will love the game as much as we do, and we hope they’ll spread the love by publishing their own adventures, rules supplements, and more.
>
>**Open Dice**. In Open Legend, dice explode! That means that whenever ANY die rolls maximum, you get to reroll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. The volatile nature of dice rolling makes every roll count, and each session of Open Legend is full of tense moments when the tides can turn at a moment’s notice, for better or worse.
>
>**Open Legend**. You get to tell the story that you want to tell, with the characters you want to play. You aren’t tied down to specific class, archetype, or race combinations. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe the GM’s veto power). Rather than a list of set classes with a menu of skills to pick from, you start the game with attribute points that you spend as you wish to give your character the powers she needs

Welcome to Open Legend, a tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG) in which the players take the part of mighty heroes and wicked villains in order to tell stories of epic proportion. As in the vignettes above, every game of Open Legend revolves around intrepid characters performing heroic deeds. They will fight mythic beasts, break ancient curses, solve mind-boggling puzzles, discover untold treasures, and more.

If you have never played a roleplaying game before, you can think of it as a movie in which the actors make up the script (and even much of the plot) as the movie is being shot. One player, called the **Game Master** (or GM), acts as producer, director, and writer. The GM establishes the setting, creates the antagonists, and develops enough plot to get the other players started. The GM also acts out the part of the villains and neutral characters in the story.

The rest of the players take the role of **Player Characters** (or PCs). The PCs are the protagonists of the story. One PC might be a dwarven warrior with a lust for gems, another an immortal elven wizard whose only desire is knowledge, and still another a half-angelic priest who travels the world in order to inspire others to act justly.

Whatever the motivation of their characters, the players share a common goal: to take the plot and setting established by the GM and have fun. At some tables, this might look like J.R.R Tolkien’s *Lord of the Rings*. In others, it might look more like *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. Whatever fun looks like at your table, Open Legend will be a part of it.

This is your story. Tell it.

## What Defines Open Legend? ##

*Open Legend* is one in a long list of RPGs currently on the market. And like so many of the games that came before and will follow after, it was created during a specific time in gaming history for a specific reason.

*Open Legend* is a game designed for players who want a balance between fluff and crunch--that is, between storytelling and game mechanics. We love telling stories with intricate plotlines that star characters of depth and beauty. But we also love rolling dice. If all we wanted to do with our friends was tell stories, we would write a novel together.

What we want to do is game. And that means we need rules.

Without well-defined rules, the decisions made by players and GMs can seem arbitrary or inconsistent. The GM may feel overburdened by a constant need to recall past rulings that she’s made, and the players may feel like their decisions don’t actually matter because the GM can interpret them however she wants. This is the opposite of how a baseball ref operates. The ref doesn’t need to create new rules for every play that he calls. The rules of the game are already spelled out. He just needs to interpret and apply them.

*Open Legend* was designed to provide enough rules so that players have a clear framework to guide their play, but not so many rules that the game gets bogged down by them. You spend your day job worrying about bookkeeping and policies. We don’t want the gaming table to feel like
that, and we designed *Open Legend* to focus on the fun rather than the homework.

For example, you won’t have long lists of resources to manage. Any abilities that you can use or spells you can cast in *Open Legend* can be used at-will. Likewise, spellcasters don’t need to worry about poring over page after page of spell descriptions in order to make the right
choices. Instead, *Open Legend* uses a system of **banes** and **boons**, or status effects, that any character can apply if he is built to do so.

Other mechanics that will ensure that you can focus on the story you want to tell include  simplified wealth and encumbrance systems. In *Open Legend*, you’ll never need to record a single gold piece on your character sheet or even think about how many pounds a long sword weighs.

*Open Legend* straddles the line between fluff and crunch.

We hope that we’ve built a game for players who love to tell a good story but don’t want every decision to be made on a whim.

We hope that we’ve built a game for players who love to shake the dice and see them roll but don’t want to spend hours min-maxing their characters.

Most of all, we hope that we’ve built a game for players like you.

## The Core Mechanic: The Action Roll ##

Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in *Open Legend* will be determined by the roll of dice.

To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character's attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.

Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll. If your total is equal to or greater than the action’s Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.

| THE ACTION ROLL |
| :-: |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| - | :--- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> - OR - <br /> *the player fails but the story progresses*. (GM’s Choice) |

#### Example

An adventuring party is traveling through the Darkwood, a forest cursed with malignant energy and cast in shadows at every turn. The party spies a gathering of lights in the distance ahead. At the same time, though, a Shade Demon has crept up behind the heroes. The GM tells Imladril, the elven ranger who is at the back of the marching order, to make a Perception roll against a Challenge Rating of 18. Imladril’s Perception score of 5 grants him a 2d6 bonus to Perception action rolls, so he grabs 1d20 + 2d6 and lets them fly.

He rolls a 7 on the d20, and the d6s come up 1 and 6. Since the 6 explodes, Imladril rolls it again and gets a 3, for a grand total of 17 (7+1+6+3), just shy of the required 18. The GM decides to allow Imladril to **succeed with a twist**, so she rules that he hears the demon fast enough to alert the party, but that the demon has already closed into melee distance and is able to knock the ranger’s bow out of his hands.

Alternatively, the GM could decide that Imladril **fails, but the story progresses**. For example, she rules that the demon is able to grab the ranger and drag him silently into the darkness completely unbeknownst to the rest of the party distracted by the lights in the distance.
