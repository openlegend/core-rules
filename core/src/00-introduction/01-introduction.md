# Introduction: This is Your Story. Tell it. #

*Deep in the bowels of a long abandoned star freighter, a pair of rogues huddle around a massive stasis pod. A shadowy form drifts through the cloudy liquid, barely discernable through the inch-thick glass. One of the explorers, covered head to toe in cybernetic implants, attempts to make sense of the hidden symbols incribed at the base of the pod, detectable only via the ultraviolet spectrum.*

*“Hold that UV beam steady!” he mutters to his companion.*

*But his whispers shatter the perfect silence permeating this vast chamber of the Zeta class cruiser, and soon the echoes are like a siren in the darkness. Pairs of red eyes awaken at the edge of the light, fires of malice that yearn to taste flesh once again. “Zak,” stutters the light bearer as she draws a shining six-shooter, “I don’t think this freighter is abandoned no more.”*

* * *

*The death throes of the orcs can be heard two realms over as they fall in waves to the heroes making their last stand upon the Ruins of Ravenwatch. Still, there is no end in sight to the horde that blackens the hills like a swarm of locusts.*

*“They come for the Stone,” grunts a dwarf, pulling his axe from the skull of another pig-headed orc. “Just give it to them, and maybe we'll get out of this alive.”*

*It is an elven maiden, tall and clad in battle worn mail, who replies: “I'll have no bard sing tales of Luthiel the Cowardly, who surrendered to orc scum while still she drew breath.”*

*As elf and dwarf bicker, a grey haired man, cloaked in emerald, stands tall atop a boulder at the center of the ruins. His eyes stare distantly, like sharp daggers, at the golden sun landing upon the horizon. With a smirk, he raises his gnarled oaken staff to the sky, where the gathering storm clouds crackle with the fury of nature's electric potential. “Gentleman, lady…” speaks the druid with soft confidence, “I think the winds have turned in our favor.”*

> ### Why Open Legend?
If you have played roleplaying games in the past, you may be wondering *What makes Open Legend worth my time? What makes it different?*
>
>The secret's in the title: Open. Everything about the game has been built to open up the doors of possibility so that every table tells a legend worth telling. Here are a few of the possibilities that Open Legend offers.
>
>**Open Source**. That's right. The unabridged core rules are available on the website and the [Open Legend Community License](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/community-license) allows for publication of both commercial as well as non-commercial derivative works using the system. We know the public will love the game as much as we do, and we hope they'll spread the love by publishing their own adventures, rules supplements, and more.
>
>**Open Dice**. In Open Legend, dice explode! That means that whenever ANY die rolls maximum, you get to reroll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. The volatile nature of dice rolling makes every roll count, and each session of Open Legend is full of tense moments when the tides can turn at a moment's notice, for better or worse.
>
>**Open Legend**. You get to tell the story that you want to tell, with the characters you want to play. You aren't tied down to specific class, archetype, or race combinations. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe the GM's veto power). Rather than a list of set classes with a menu of skills to pick from, you start the game with attribute points that you spend as you wish to give your character the powers they need.

Welcome to Open Legend, a tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG) in which the players take the part of mighty heroes and wicked villains in order to tell stories of epic proportion. As in the vignettes above, every game of Open Legend revolves around intrepid characters performing heroic deeds. They will fight mythic beasts, outsmart cunning foes, break ancient curses, crack baffling cases, discover untold treasures, and more.

If you have never played a roleplaying game before, you can think of it as a movie in which the actors make up the script (and even much of the plot) as the movie is being shot. One player, called the **Game Master** (or GM), acts as producer, director, and writer. The GM establishes the setting, creates the antagonists, and develops enough plot to get the other players started. The GM also acts out the part of the villains and neutral characters in the story.

The rest of the players take the role of **Player Characters** (or PCs). The PCs are the protagonists of the story. In a high fantasy setting, one PC might be a dwarven warrior with a lust for gems, another an immortal elven wizard whose only desire is knowledge, and still another a half-angelic priest who travels the world in order to inspire others to act justly. In another game of Open Legend, the players might star as a rag tag crew of space pirates living from score to score on their barely functioning merchant class starship. All the common tropes could make an appearance: the reckless pilot, the brash captain with a troubled past, the hired gun, the stowaway, and the engineer who gets along with the ship better than with the crew.

Whatever the motivation of their characters, the players share a common goal: to take the plot and setting established by the GM and have fun. At some tables, this might look like J.R.R Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings*. In others, it might look more like *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. Whatever fun looks like at your table, Open Legend will be a part of it.

This is your story. Tell it.

## What Defines Open Legend? ##

Open Legend is a game designed for players who want enough rules to make a game fair, but not so many that the rules interfere with the fun or imagination. *Open Legend* provides a way to make sure that the game is balanced while adjusting the story of character abilities on the fly. The rules should be robust, but their only value is in telling a story.

For example, Open Legend's streamlined systems for secondary effects (banes) and multi-target attacks mean that all characters use the same mechanics to craft unique attacks. In a fantasy campaign, an elemental mage might blast a fork of lightning to damage and stun his foes. A star trooper in a far future campaign might shoot an energy beam to create the very same effect. The rules for both attacks are the same regardless of the story you are using the mechanics to tell.

As storytellers, we love intricate plotlines that feature characters of depth and beauty. But as gamers, we also love rolling dice. If all we wanted to do with our friends was tell stories, we would write a novel together or join an improv theater group.

What we want to do is game. And that means we need rules.

Without well-defined rules, the decisions made by players and GMs can seem arbitrary or inconsistent. The GM may feel overburdened by a constant need to recall past rulings that they have made, and the players may feel like their decisions don't actually matter because the GM can interpret them however they want. This is the opposite of how a baseball ref operates. The ref doesn't need to create new rules for every play that they call. The rules of the game are already spelled out. They just need to interpret and apply them.

Open Legend was designed to provide enough rules so that players have a clear framework to guide their play, but not so many rules that the game gets bogged down by them. You spend your day job worrying about bookkeeping and policies. We don't want the gaming table to feel like that, and we designed Open Legend to focus on the fun rather than the homework.

For example, you won't have long lists of resources to manage. Any abilities that you can use or spells you can cast in Open Legend can be used at will. Likewise, spellcasters, psions, and techies don't need to worry about poring over page after page of power descriptions in order to make the right choices. Instead, Open Legend uses a system of **banes** and **boons**, or status effects, that any character can apply if they are built to do so.

Other mechanics that will ensure that you can focus on the story you want to tell include simplified wealth and encumbrance systems. In Open Legend, you'll never need to record a single gold piece on your character sheet or even think about how many pounds your revolver weighs.

Open Legend straddles the line between storytelling and rules mechanics by giving the best of both worlds. It emphasizes both storytelling and strategy at the same time, placing less restrictions on both.

We hope that we've built a game for players who love to tell a good story but don't want every decision to be made on a whim.

We hope that we've built a game for players who love to shake the dice and see them roll but don't want to spend hours min-maxing their characters.

Most of all, we hope that we've built a game for players like you.

## The Core Mechanic: The Action Roll ##

Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in Open Legend will be determined by the roll of dice.

To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character's attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.

Add all of the dice together to find your action roll total. If your total is equal to or greater than the action's Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.

| THE ACTION ROLL |
| :-: |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :-- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> - OR - <br /> *the player fails but the story progresses*. (GM's Choice) |

> ### Example Action Roll
>
> An adventuring party is traveling through the Darkwood, a forest cursed with malignant energy and cast in shadows at every turn. The party spies a gathering of lights in the distance ahead. At the same time, though, a Shade Demon has crept up behind the heroes. The GM tells Imladril, the elven ranger who is at the back of the marching order, to make a Perception roll against a Challenge Rating of 18. Imladril's Perception score of 5 grants him a 2d6 bonus to Perception action rolls, so he grabs 1d20 + 2d6 and lets them fly.
>
> Imladril rolls a 7 on the d20, and the d6s come up 1 and 6. Since the 6 explodes, the die is rolled again and it comes up a 3, for a grand total of 17 (7+1+6+3), just shy of the required 18. The GM decides to allow Imladril to **succeed with a twist**, so the GM rules that Imladril hears the demon fast enough to alert the party, but the demon is already within melee distance and is able to knock the ranger's bow out of his hands before the combat begins.
>
> Alternatively, the GM could decide that Imladril **fails, but the story progresses**. For example, the GM rules that the demon is able to grab the ranger and drag him silently into the darkness completely unbeknownst to the rest of the party distracted by the lights in the distance.
