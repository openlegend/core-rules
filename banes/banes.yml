    You blind your foe with anything from a massive explosion, to a handful of sand, to an arctic blast, to a dazzling flash of light. Pirates, snipers, rogues, and necromancers often make use of this bane in combat.
  effect: |
    The target cannot see as long as the effect persists. The target automatically fails any Perception rolls based solely on normal sight. Attack rolls and Perception rolls based partially on sight that can be supplemented by another sense suffer disadvantage 5. The target's Guard defense is reduced by 3.

    Charms are one of the great banes of legend, wielded by powerful enchantresses like Circe (of Homer's The Odyssey), nymphs, psychics, and other characters who control the will of others, not through total domination, but through a magical spell of love or friendship.
  effect: |
    The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The charmed bane manifests at two levels: minor and major.
    <strong>Minor Charm</strong> - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately. If they are about to strike you, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation goes away.
    <strong>Major Charm</strong> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The target is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.
    The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence. You can Major Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can Major Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence.</li>
      </ul>
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Utilizing either incredible precision or the power of entropy, you snuff out the target's life force completely. The deadliest assassins and most powerful necromancers are known for such legendary skill at ending life.
  effect: |
    Upon a successful invocation, the target is immediately rendered immobile, unconscious, and unable to take actions. They have disadvantage 5 on all Perception rolls, and any damaging attacks against them count as finishing blows.
    If the target fails three resist rolls to shake off this bane, they die. The death is permanent and can only be reversed if the GM allows a special mission, use of a rare technology, or long-forgotten magic to restore the target to life.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane renders the target incapable of taking actions and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's body fights to regain consciousness and resist the impending death.

    Though rare, domination is seen from time to time in legendary tales, often wielded by vampires, and sometimes by the most powerful of sorcerers or mad scientists who command legions of mindless zombies, completely enslaved to their will.
  effect: |
    The dominated bane manifests at two levels: lesser and greater.
    <strong>Lesser Domination</strong> - The target obeys a one word command until the end of their next turn, at which time the bane immediately ends.
    <strong>Greater Domination</strong> - The target's every action and move is under your control. Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, struggle to regain control of their own body. They cannot take actions of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a free action to end the effect. The attacker does not gain special access to the target's mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However, the order can be a series of verbal commands, such “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time. Greater Domination has a duration of Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 hour).
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, certain undead, etc.) with Lesser Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or better with Lesser Domination. You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, etc.) with Greater Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or greater with Greater Domination.</li>

  description: |
    You cause the target's body to wither and weaken, gradually losing its ability to function until the victim finally succumbs to death. Fatigue may be the result of a necromancer's curse, an assassin's poison, a radiation ray, or similar life sapping effects.
  effect: |
    This bane has multiple tiers which are applied in succession. Each time this bane is inflicted, if it is already in effect on the target, the severity escalates by one level.<br/>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1</strong> - The target has disadvantage 1 on all non-attack action rolls.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2</strong> - The target is affected by the slowed bane, reducing its speed by half. This instance of the slowed bane cannot be resisted as normal. It persists until the fatigue is removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3</strong> - The target has disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 4</strong> - The target loses their attribute bonuses to their defense scores (Agility and Might for Guard, Fortitude and Will for Toughness, Will and Presence for Resolve). They retain any armor, extraordinary, or feat bonuses.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 5</strong> - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances prevent the target from resting peacefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 6</strong> - The target dies.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    Unlike other banes, canceling this bane takes time and rest. Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion removes one level of fatigue. If the *restoration* boon is successfully invoked to dispel this bane, only one level of fatigue is removed (in addition to that removed by natural rest). If the *restoration* boon's invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one. A target may only benefit from one invocation of the *restoration* boon to remove fatigue within a 24 hour period.

  effect: |
    On its turn, the afflicted target must use its entire turn to get as far away as possible from you. It cannot use its actions to do anything other than retreat, and it cannot willingly move closer to you while the bane persists.

    Whether through grappling, a precise nerve strike, entangling vines, mental compulsion, or a bone-numbing blast of cold, you render your foe incapable of movement. This bane is typical among martial artists, special ops agents, enchanters, and wrestlers.
  effect: |
    Your target cannot move from its current space. If you invoked the bane with a Might roll and are within 5' of the target, then both you and the target are immobile in your current space for the duration of the bane (locked in a grapple). While grappling in this manner, you can attempt to inflict this bane again upon the target. If successful, you can move your speed and take the target with you. If this attack fails, you can only move by first releasing the target and ending the bane.
    If you invoked the bane with any attribute other than Might, you can move freely while the target remains affected.
    You can choose to release the target as a free action, immediately ending the bane.

  effect: |
    The target is immobile (can't move from their current space) and unconscious. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls and are incapable of moving. As a result of being completely incapable of movement, an incapacitated character can be the victim of a finishing blow. <ul><li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - The effect can be broken by a moderate disruption, such as a firm shove, a kick, glass of water, loud bang, etc.</li><li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - The effect can only be broken if the target takes 1 point of damage or more.</li><li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - The effect cannot be disrupted by external forces.

  effect: |
    The target falls prone. Prone targets have disadvantage 1 on all attacks they make. Characters that are prone due to the *knockdown* bane (or any other reason) get +2 to Guard versus Ranged attacks and -2 Guard versus Melee attacks.

    Warping or controlling the mind is one of the most dreaded powers of enchanters, causing powerful heroes to forget their homes, families, and quests. Memory alteration is often inflicted by mad scientists, necromancers, enchanters, and chronomancers.
  effect: |
    You alter the target's memories to an extent based on the power level of the bane.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - You temporarily modify a minor aspect of the target's memory. The target automatically regains the lost memory and realizes their confusion 1 hour later.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You permanently erase or alter the last 5 minutes of the target's memory. The target does not know what happened during this time outside of the memories you feed them (including having seen you, if they did). Multiple uses of this bane progressively erase consecutive 5 minute increments.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Instead of the immediate past, you can erase or alter memories from any time.</li>

    The memory alteration bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane.

  effect: |
    You cancel a single boon currently in effect if it is of this bane's power level or lower. The invoking power level further impacts the effect as follows:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 1</strong> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 1. You can cancel a boon that must be actively invoked. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.</li>

      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 3.</li>

Effects that would prevent Nullify from being invoked in this way have no effect. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.</li>

    Whether by setting the target ablaze, covering them in acid, slicing an artery, or cursing them with a wasting disease, you inflict your foe with a lasting and recurring source of damage. Persistent damage is a favorite among assassins, mad scientists, and elementalists.
  effect: |
    At the beginning of the target's turn, before they take any actions, they suffer damage determined by the power level of the bane. This damage automatically bypasses the afflicted character's defenses but it can be reduced by any resistance to damage of a certain type (see the resistance boon). Like all dice rolls, these dice explode.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 2</strong> - 1d4 damage per round.</li>

  special: |
    Persistent damage comes in a number of different variations: physical damage (bleeding from a vital strike), energy damage (lightning, fire, cold, acid, etc.) and entropic damage (necromantic energy), among others. Each variation has its own cure. When that cure is applied with a major action (either by the afflicted character or another), the target receives a resist roll (as a free action) with advantage 1 to end the effect. The GM has the final word on whether a proposed cure can help a given type of persistent damage, but the  following examples can help with arbitration:
    <ul>
      <li>Bleeding damage is cured with a successful roll using Learning, Logic, or Creation.</li>
      <li>Lightning damage is cured by a discharge or grounding of the current.</li>

  description: |
    You create an illusory manifestation to deceive the senses. Some examples include making a meal taste rotten, altering the data on a screen where a user is logging in, creating the sound of a stampede of horses, hiding allies behind a false wall, or creating an illusion of an intergalactic emperor who can converse intelligibly.
  effect: |
    You create a phantasm of your choosing. The power level at which you invoke the bane determines which senses you can deceive as well as the maximum size of your illusion, as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 1</strong> - Affect Taste. Manifest a 5' x 5' x 5' area phantasm.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 2</strong> - Affect Smell, Sound, or Touch.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Affect Sight.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - Manifest a 10' x 10' x 10' area phantasm.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Manifest a 15' x 15' x 15' area phantasm.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Affect All Senses.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - Manifest a 20' x 20' x 20' area phantasm.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Manifest a 30' x 30' x 30' area phantasm.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Manifest a 50' x 50' x 50' area phantasm.</li>
    </ul>
    Until reaching power level 6, you can combine sensory illusions by adding the required power levels together (e.g., mimicking both sight and sound requires power level 5). While the phantasm persists, you can make logical changes to it freely. For example, an illusory person can speak naturally as you direct it and could be made to fall in response to an attack. However, substantial changes to the illusion (such as transforming a human into a goblin) require a new invocation of the illusion.
  special: |
    Unlike other banes, this bane does not work by targeting specific enemies. Instead, your Influence roll for invoking it is compared with the Resolve defense of each character that would perceive the created effect if it were real. If the roll is lower than their Resolve, they perceive none of the phantasm's effects. If the roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve, they perceive the illusory effect you create and react as if it were real.
    When mimicking a very specific person, place, or thing that the target is very familiar with, the GM should consider increasing the target's Resolve defense for the purpose of that particular phantasm invocation.
    Characters convinced by the phantasm can roll Resist as normal in order to attempt to shake off the bane. If successful, they are no longer deceived by the effect. In addition, you must spend a minor action to sustain the bane during each of your turns. Failing to do so in a given round causes the bane's effects to cease at the end of your turn.
    When an affected character succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent phantasms invoked by you for the next hour.

  attack:
  - Alteration vs. Toughness
  invocationTime: 1 Minute
  duration: Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 hour)
  description: |
    You alter the size, shape, and composition of the target by causing them to grow, shrink, or assume a completely new form, like that of a sheep or a newt. Polymorph might be accomplished by a druid's curse, a mad scientist's transmogrification ray, or exposure to alien radiation.
  effect: |
    Your power level determines the extent to which you can transform your target, as follows. If the target is transformed into a different creature, it uses the Might, Agility, Fortitude, and Perception attribute scores of the new creature.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of the same size. This new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 2. If the new form would have higher attributes, the target becomes an exceptional version of that creature. For example, transforming a deadly sniper with Agility 5 into a clumsy ogre with Agility 0, would leave the target with an Agility of 3 instead of the 0 typical for the new form.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between double and half the size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 3.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between quadruple and one-quarter its original size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 5.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of any size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 7.</li>
    </ul>
    In order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Agent Walker has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a sheep and has her Fortitude reduced by 2, leaving her at 16 hit points. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total becomes 1 instead.

    Through a display of awe-inspiring force, intimidation, or leadership, you command attention as the greatest threat, causing others to fear attacking your allies. Examples include a brute smashing the skull of a lesser foe, a gunslinger hurling insults, or a space captain diving into the middle of a swirling melee with plasma blades flashing.
  effect: |
    Any attacks made by the target that do not include you as a target suffer disadvantage. If the same target is affected by this bane from multiple sources, as long as their attack includes one of those who targeted them, they are not affected by the penalty. Unlike other banes, your damaging attack against one target can trigger this bane in a different target, provided your roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve defense (that is, by striking one foe, you can provoke another).
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 1 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 2 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 3 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 4 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 5 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 6 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    Resisting this bane is a minor action.
    When inflicting this bane using Agility or Might, you may determine range using the Non-Physical Attack Range table (see Chapter 7: Combat).

    Either through innate extrasensory perception or a special conduit such as a computer terminal, bubbling cauldron, or a crystal ball, you can view the target from a distance.
  effect: |
    You can spy on a person or area that you are familiar with. The power level of this bane determines the maximum distance between you and the target. If successfully invoked, you can see and hear everything that goes on within a 60' radius of your target. Anyone within the targeted area who has a Resolve defense score higher than your Prescience action roll to invoke this bane becomes aware of an unseen presence in the area (regardless of whether or not you succeed at the roll). Certain creatures may be able to identify your spying if they are familiar with such powers.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - 1 mile or less</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - 100 miles or less</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - More than 100 miles, but on the same dimension or plane of reality</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Any dimension or plane of reality. (Peering into certain dimensions may expose you to other dangers at the GM's discretion).</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make a Prescience roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated. However, you must retest your new roll against the Resolve scores of those in the targeted area to determine whether or not they can sense your presence.
    You can attempt to spy the same target any number of times, but if your action roll fails, that target becomes immune to your spying for 24 hours.

    Silence overcomes the target, whether from the warping of sound around the target, or from a physical effect like strangulation or suffocation. The silence bane is a favorite among assassins, sorcerers, engineers, and mad scientists.
  effect: |
    If Might, Agility, or Entropy is used to inflict this bane, then the character is suffering strangulation and unable to speak. If the bane is inflicted using Alteration, then all sound within 5' of the target is suppressed through extraordinary means, making their footsteps and the usual clank of belongings they are carrying inaudible.

    The target's movement is impaired, either by extreme cold, prolonged heat, poison, or injury to one or both legs. This bane is a favored attack among rogues, ice mages, telekinetisists, and gunslingers.
  effect: |
    The afflicted target's speed is reduced to half its current speed, rounded down to the nearest 5' increment. This applies to all movement that is physical (flight, walking, climbing, etc.). If the target is currently under a magical effect that increases speed, the two effects are canceled for the duration that both affect the target.

    You disorient the target's senses, causing them to act much less efficiently. Stunning an enemy can be caused by attacks such as a pistol whip to the back of the head, a kick in the groin, and a deafening thunderclap.
  effect: |
    During the target's turn, they are limited to either a single major action, a single move action, or a single minor action. Effects that grant additional actions do not circumvent this unless they grant a free action. Note that a target expending its move action to resist this bane will receive the remainder of their usual actions if the resist roll succeeds.
  special: |
    This bane has special rules for boss NPCs (See Chapter 8: Running the Game). A boss is only affected by the stunned bane during its normal initiative turn. It may still take all of its boss actions as usual.

  duration: Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
  description: |
    The stupefied bane has examples in many stories and legends: a vampire's eyes, a siren's song, and a nymph's beauty are all known to cast a stupor upon weak-willed mortals. Being stupefied causes the target to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and pacifism.
  effect: |
    The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the target's Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the target has the approximate intelligence of a child. If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional resist roll to break free from the bane. Also any action that would startle a wild animal (being hit with a rock, slapped on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target's typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    By controlling the target's mind through compulsion magic, chemical injection, neural probes, or similar means, you render them incapable of lying deliberately. This is a favored bane among enchanters, mad scientists, psychics, and thought police.
  effect: |
    The target answers any question asked with honesty, to the best of their knowledge. When compelled to reveal something they would not reveal outside of duress, the target makes a Will roll and you make an Influence roll. If the target's roll is higher than yours, then they resist the bane and the effect ends.
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make another Influence roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated.
    When a target wins the contested Will vs. Influence roll, you cannot target them with this bane again for 24 hours.
