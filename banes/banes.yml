    Wielding protective magic, you force an extraplanar creature to return to its home plane.
  effect: |
    The creature is forced to return to its home plane.  More powerful extraplanar beings may have ways of circumventing this banishment. However, typical non-legendary beings cannot. While the duration is instantaneous, the targeted creature cannot simply attempt to return by plane shifting immediately after being banished. The creature can attempt a Resist roll once per week to end the banishment and once again be capable of plane shifting to the plane they were previously banished from.

    Charms are one of the great banes of legend, wielded by powerful enchantresses like Circe (in Homer's The Odyssey), nymphs, and other enchanters who control the will of others, not through total domination, but through a magical spell of love or friendship.
  effect: |
    The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The Charmed bane manifests at two levels: minor and major.
    <strong>Minor Charm</strong> - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately.  If they are about to strike you with a piece of furniture, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent.  If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation goes away.
    <strong>Major Charm</strong> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The attacker is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.
    The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - You can Minor Charm, creatures of humanoid intelligence. You can Major Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can Major Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence.</li>
      </ul>
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the targets true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control.  As such, at the end of each of it’s turns, the target receives a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Utilizing either incredible precision or the power of entropy, the target’s life force is snuffed out completely. The most deadly assassins and most powerful necromancers are known for such legendary skill at snuffing out life.
  effect: |
    You attempt to completely snuff the life force of your target.  There is a brief window of time in which the target can attempt to resist this extinguishing force, but once that window closes, the death is permanent and can only be reversed with resurrection magic.  When the bane is initially applied, the target is immobile (can’t move from their current square) and unconscious. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls, and are incapable of moving. As a result of being completely incapable of movement, an incapacitated character can be the victim of a finishing blow.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the targets body fights to regain consciousness and resist the pending death.  As such, at the end of each of it’s turns, the target receives a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect.  Whereas 3 failed resist rolls would usually persist the effects of the bane, this bane extinguishes the life force of the target on 3 failed saves, thus it is permanent. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Whether through wrestling it from your opponent, forcefully knocking it out of their hand, skilfully parrying a weapon, a precise nerve strike, magical summoning of vines, etc., heating or chilling an item in their hands, giving a mental command, weakening the muscles they use to grip, or warping the shape of the item, you force an opponent to lose control of an object they are holding.

    Though rare, domination is seen from time to time in legendary tales, often wielded by vampires, and sometimes by the most powerful of sorcerers who command legions of mindless zombies, completely enslaved to their will.
  effect: |
    The dominated bane manifests at two levels: lesser and greater.
    <strong>Lesser Domination</strong> - the target obeys a one word command until the end of their next turn.
    <strong>Greater Domination</strong> - The target's every action and move is under your control. Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, can think freely, leaving them effectively trapped in their own body. They cannot take action of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect.  The attacker does not gain special access to the target’s mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think or know (from prior knowledge) that the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action, however the order can be a series of verbal commands like “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee.”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time, so giving a new command cancels all previous ones.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, certain undead, etc.) with Lesser Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or better with Lesser Domination. You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, etc.) with Greater Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or greater with Greater Domination</li>

    Fatigue overcomes the target, causing their body to gradually cease normal function until they rest.
  effect: |
    This bane has multiple tiers which are applied in succession. Each time this bane is inflicted, if it is already in effect on the target, the severity escalates by one level.<br/>
    <strong>Special:</strong> Unlike other banes, canceling this bane takes time and rest. Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion, removes one level of fatigue. If the Restoration boon is invoked, the character invoking it can remove one level of Fatigue (in addition to that removed by natural rest) if their attribute used to invoke Restoration is between 1 and 6. A target cannot benefit from another invocation of the Restoration boon until 24 hours have passed. If the Restoration boon's invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one.
     <ul>
     <li>Level 1 - The target has Disadvantage 1 on all non-attack action rolls.</li>
     <li>Level 2 - The target loses their attribute bonus to their defense scores (Agility for Evasion, Fortitude for Toughness, Will and Prescience for Resolve). They retain any armor, supernatural, or feat bonuses.</li>
     <li>Level 3 - The target has Disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.</li>
     <li>Level 4 - The target is affected by the slowed bane, reducing it's speed to 2. This instance of the slowed bane cannot be resisted as normal. It persists until the fatigue is removed.</li>
     <li>Level 5 - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances prevent the target from resting peacefully.</li>
     <li>Level 6 - The target dies.</li>

  effect: |
    Your target cannot move from its current space. If you invoked the bane with a Might roll, then both you and the target are immobile in your current space for the duration of the bane (locked in a grapple). While grappling in this manner, you can attempt to inflict this bane again upon the target. If successful, you can move your movement and take the target with you.  If this attack fails, you can only move by first releasing the target and ending the bane.

    You can choose to release the target at any time (a free action that immediately ends the bane).

    Persistent damage comes in a number of different variations: Physical damage (bleeding damage from a vital strike), Energy damage (lightning, fire, cold, acid, etc.) and entropic damage (necromantic energy).

    You create an illusory manifestation to deceive the senses of all within range. Some examples include making a meal taste rotten, creating the sound of a stampede of horses, hiding allies behind a false wall, and even manifesting an elven noble who can converse intelligibly.
  effect: |
    You create a phantasm of your choosing. The Power Level at which you invoke the bane determines which senses you can manifest. Until reaching Power Level 6, you can combine sensory illusions by adding the required Power Levels together (e.g., mimicking both sight and sound requires Power Level 5). While the phantasm persists, you can make logical changes to it freely. For example, an illusory person can speak naturally as you direct it and could be made to fall in response to an attack. However, substantial changes to the illusion (such as transforming a human into a goblin) require a new invocation of the illusion.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 1</strong> - Taste</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 2</strong> - Sound</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 2</strong> - Smell</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 2</strong> - Touch</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Sight</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - All Senses</li>
    </ul>
    Your Influence attribute score determines the maximum area that your phantasm can cover as follows. The dimensions are depth, width, and height (all squares must touch but can be in any shape/pattern)
    <ul>
    <li>Influence 1 - 5' x 5' x 5'</li>
    <li>Influence 3 - 10' x 10' x 10'</li>
    <li>Influence 5 - 15' x 15' x 15'</li>
    <li>Influence 7 - 20' x 20' x 20'</li>
    <li>Influence 8 - 30' x 30' x 30'</li>
    <li>Influence 9 - 40' x 40' x 40'</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    When you invoke the phantasm bane, your Influence action roll determines who is convinced by the illusion. Any creatures with a Resolve defense score less than or equal to your roll will believe the phantasm to be real and will react accordingly. Those with a higher Resolve score will notice that their senses are being deceived somehow. Creatures who are convinced by the phantasm can use the resist action as normal in order to attempt to shake off the bane. If successful, they are no longer deceived by the illusion.
    When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next hour.

    You alter the size, shape, and composition of another creature. Make an enemy larger or smaller. Turn them into a sheep, newt, or whatever your imagination desires.
  effect: |
    Your Power Level determines the extent to which you can transform your target. If the target is transformed into a different creature, it uses the Might, Agility, Fortitude, and Perception attribute scores of the new creature.
    <ul>

  invocationTime: 10 Minutes
  duration: 10 minutes (Special)
  description: |
    Peering into a supernatural conduit such as a hearth, a bubbling cauldron, or a crystal ball, you see can view the target from a distance.
  effect: |
    You can scry on a person or area that you are familiar with. The Challenge Rating to succeed at this scrying is based on the distance between you and the target. If successful, you can see and hear everything that goes on within a 60' radius of your target. Anyone within the targeted area who has a Resolve defense score higher than your Prescience action roll to invoke this bane becomes aware of an unseen presence in the area (regardless of whether or not you succeed at the roll). Certain creatures may be able to identify your scrying if they are familiar with such powers.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>20</strong> - 1 mile or less</li>
    <li><strong>22</strong> - 100 miles or less</li>
    <li><strong>24</strong> - More than 100 miles, but on the same dimension or plane of reality</li>
    <li><strong>28</strong> - Any dimension or plane of reality. (Peering into certain dimensions may expose you to other dangers at the GM's discretion).</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of it's duration, you can make a Prescience roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated. However, you must retest your new roll against the Resolve scores of those in the targeted area to determine whether or not they can sense your presence.
    You can attempt to scry the same target any number of times, but if your action roll fails, that target becomes immune to your scrying for 24 hours.

If the bane is inflicted using Alteration, then all sound within 5’ of the target is magically suppressed, making their footsteps and the usual clank of belongings they are carrying inaudible.

  attack:
  - Influence vs. Resolve
  invocationTime: 1 Major Action
  duration: Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
  description: |
    The stupefied bane has examples in many stories and legends: a vampire’s eyes, a siren's song, and a nymph's beauty are all known to cast a stupor upon weak-willed mortals. Being stupefied causes the character to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and pacifism.
  effect: |
    The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the character’s Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the character has the approximate intelligence of a child. If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively planning to break free. However, the target's true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control.  As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect.  Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional Resist roll to break free from the bane.  Also any action that would startle a wild animal (hit with a rock, slap on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free Resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target’s typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

  description: |
    Being surprised is being caught flat-footed and scrambling to react to an enemy that the character was either unaware of or did not realize was an enemy.
  effect: |
    All attackers gain advantage 1 against surprised characters. Surprised characters cannot take any actions that are interrupt actions.
  special: |
    Unlike other banes, surprised cannot by inflicted directly with an action roll. Instead, it is determined by situations resulting from the story, such as a party being ambushed by a band of thieves hiding in the brush.
    Under certain conditions a character may be surprised against <strong>only one opponent</strong>. The most common example being an opponent that is disguised, hiding, invisible, or for some other reason <em>not perceived as a threat</em>.

  invocationTime: 10 Minutes
  duration: 10 minutes (Special)
  description: |
    With supernatural control of the mind, you compel the target to honesty, rendering them unable to speak falsely.
  effect: |
    The target answers any question asked with honesty, to the best of their knowledge. When compelled to reveal something they would not reveal outside of duress, the target makes a Will roll and you make an Influence roll. If the target's roll is higher than yours, then they resist the bane and the effect ends.
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make another Influence roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated.
    When a target resists the bane, you cannot target them with this bane again for 24 hours.
