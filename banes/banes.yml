    Charms are one of the great banes of legend, wielded by powerful enchantresses like Circe (in Homer's The Odyssey), nymphs, and other enchanters who control the will of others, not through total domination, but through a magical spell of love or friendship.
  effect: |
    The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The charmed bane manifests at two levels: minor and major.
    <strong>Minor Charm</strong> - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately. If they are about to strike you, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation goes away.
    <strong>Major Charm</strong> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The attacker is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.
    The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence. You can Major Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can Major Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence.</li>
      </ul>
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Utilizing either incredible precision or the power of entropy, the target's life force is snuffed out completely. The deadliest assassins and most powerful necromancers are known for such legendary skill at ending life.
  effect: |
    Upon a successful invocation, the target is immediately rendered immobile, unconscious, and unable to take actions. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls, and any damaging attacks against them count as finishing blows.
    If the target fails three resist rolls to shake off this bane, they die. The death is permanent and can only be reversed if the GM allows a special mission to use rare technology or long-forgotten magic to restore the target to life.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane renders the target incapable of taking actions and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free.

    Though rare, domination is seen from time to time in legendary tales, often wielded by vampires, and sometimes by the most powerful of sorcerers who command legions of mindless zombies, completely enslaved to their will.
  effect: |
    The dominated bane manifests at two levels: lesser and greater.
    <strong>Lesser Domination</strong> - The target obeys a one word command until the end of their next turn.
    <strong>Greater Domination</strong> - The target's every action and move is under your control. Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, can think freely, leaving them effectively trapped in their own body. They cannot take action of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. The attacker does not gain special access to the target's mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think or know that the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However, the order can be a series of verbal commands, such “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee.”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time, so giving a new command cancels all previous ones.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, certain undead, etc.) with Lesser Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or better with Lesser Domination. You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, etc.) with Greater Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or greater with Greater Domination.</li>

    Fatigue overcomes the target, causing their body to gradually cease normal function until they rest.
  effect: |
    This bane has multiple tiers which are applied in succession. Each time this bane is inflicted, if it is already in effect on the target, the severity escalates by one level.<br/>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Level 1</strong> - The target has disadvantage 1 on all non-attack action rolls.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 2</strong> - The target is affected by the slowed bane, reducing its speed by half. This instance of the slowed bane cannot be resisted as normal. It persists until the fatigue is removed.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 3</strong> - The target has disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 4</strong> - The target loses their attribute bonuses to their defense scores (Agility and Might for Guard, Fortitude and Will for Toughness, Will and Presence for Resolve). They retain any armor, extraordinary, or feat bonuses.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 5</strong> - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances prevent the target from resting peacefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Level 6</strong> - The target dies.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    Unlike other banes, canceling this bane takes time and rest. Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion removes one level of fatigue. If the restoration boon is invoked, the character invoking it can remove one level of Fatigue (in addition to that removed by natural rest) if their attribute used to invoke restoration is between 1 and 6. A target cannot benefit from another invocation of the restoration boon until 24 hours have passed. If the restoration boon's invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one.

  effect: |
    Your target cannot move from its current space. If you invoked the bane with a Might roll, then both you and the target are immobile in your current space for the duration of the bane (locked in a grapple). While grappling in this manner, you can attempt to inflict this bane again upon the target. If successful, you can move your speed and take the target with you. If this attack fails, you can only move by first releasing the target and ending the bane.

The target does not know what happened during this time outside of the memories you feed them (including having seen you, if they did). Multiple uses of this bane progressively erase consecutive 5 minute increments.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Instead of the immediate past, you can erase or alter memories from any time.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 1</strong> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 1. You can cancel a boon that must be actively invoked. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute</li>

Effects that would prevent Nullify from being invoked in this way have no effect. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> -  Cancel a boon of Power Level 7</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> -  Cancel a boon of Power Level 8</li>

    Whether by setting the target ablaze, covering them in acid, slicing an artery, or cursing them with a wasting disease, you inflict your foe with a lasting and recurring source of damage.
  effect: |
    At the beginning of the target's turn, before they take any actions, they suffer damage determined by the power level of the bane. This damage automatically bypasses the afflicted character's defenses but it can be reduced by any resistance to damage of a certain type (see the resistance boon). Like all dice rolls, these dice explode.

  special: |
    Persistent damage comes in a number of different variations: physical damage (bleeding from a vital strike), energy damage (lightning, fire, cold, acid, etc.) and entropic damage (necromantic energy), among others. Each variation has its own cure. When that cure is applied with a major action (either by the afflicted character or another), the target receives a resist roll (as a free action) with advantage 1 to end the effect. The GM has the final word on whether a proposed cure can help a given type of persistent damage, but the  following examples can help with arbitration:
    <ul>
      <li>Bleeding damage is cured with a successful roll using Learning, Logic, or Creation.</li>
      <li>Lightning damage is cured by a discharge or grounding of the current.</li>
      <li>Cold damage is countered with warmth, heat, or fire.</li>
      <li>Acid damage is neutralized with alkalizing agents (powder, milk, etc.).</li>
      <li>Fire damage is neutralized with water or smothering.</li>
      <li>Entropic damage is neutralized with extraordinary or magical healing.</li>

    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - Manifest a 20' x 20' x 20' area phantasm</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Manifest a 30' x 30' x 30' area phantasm</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Manifest a 50' x 50' x 50' area phantasm</li>
    </ul>
    Until reaching power level 6, you can combine sensory illusions by adding the required power levels together (e.g., mimicking both sight and sound requires power level 5). While the phantasm persists, you can make logical changes to it freely. For example, an illusory person can speak naturally as you direct it and could be made to fall in response to an attack. However, substantial changes to the illusion (such as transforming a human into a goblin) require a new invocation of the illusion.
  special: |
    Unlike other banes, this bane does not work by targeting specific enemies. Instead, your Influence roll for invoking it is compared with the Resolve defense of each character that would perceive the created effect if it were real. If the roll is lower than their Resolve, they perceive none of the phantasm's effects. If the roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve, they perceive the illusory effect you create and react as if it were real.
    When mimicking a very specific person, place, or thing that the target is very familiar with, the GM should consider increasing the target's Resolve defense for the purpose of that particular phantasm invocation.
    Characters convinced by the phantasm can roll Resist as normal in order to attempt to shake off the bane. If successful, they are no longer deceived by the effect. In addition, you must spend a minor action to sustain the bane during each of your turns. Failing to do so in a given round causes the bane's effects to cease at the end of your turn.
    When an affected character succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent phantasms invoked by you for the next hour.

    You alter the size, shape, and composition of another creature; make an enemy larger or smaller; turn them into a sheep, newt, or whatever your imagination desires.
  effect: |
    Your power level determines the extent to which you can transform your target, as follows. If the target is transformed into a different creature, it uses the Might, Agility, Fortitude, and Perception attribute scores of the new creature.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of the same size. This new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 2. If the new form would have higher attributes, the target becomes an exceptional version of that creature. For example, transforming a deadly sniper with Agility 5 into a clumsy ogre with Agility 0, would leave the target with an Agility of 3 instead of the 0 typical for the new form.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between double and half the size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 3.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between quadruple and one-quarter its original size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 5.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of any size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. The new form can reduce the target's attribute scores by up to 7.</li>
    </ul>
    In order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Agent Walker has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a sheep and has her Fortitude reduced by 2, leaving her at 16 hit points. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target's hit points to less than 1, the target's hit point total becomes 1 instead.

    Through a display of awe-inspiring force, intimidation, or leadership, you command attention as the greatest threat, causing others to fear attacking your allies.
  effect: |
    Any attacks made by the target that do not include you as a target suffer disadvantage. If the same target is affected by this bane from multiple sources, as long as their attack includes one of those who targeted them, they are not affected by the penalty. Unlike other banes, your damaging attack against one target can trigger this bane in a different target, provided your roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve defense (that is, by striking one foe, you can provoke another).
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 1 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 2 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 3 on attacks that do not include you.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - The target suffers disadvantage 4 on attacks that do not include you.</li>

    Either through innate extrasensory perception or a special conduit such as a computer terminal, bubbling cauldron, or a crystal ball, you can view the target from a distance.
  effect: |
    You can scry on a person or area that you are familiar with. The power level of this bane determines the maximum distance between you and the target. If successfully invoked, you can see and hear everything that goes on within a 60' radius of your target. Anyone within the targeted area who has a Resolve defense score higher than your Prescience action roll to invoke this bane becomes aware of an unseen presence in the area (regardless of whether or not you succeed at the roll). Certain creatures may be able to identify your scrying if they are familiar with such powers.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - 1 mile or less</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - 100 miles or less</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - More than 100 miles, but on the same dimension or plane of reality</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Any dimension or plane of reality. (Peering into certain dimensions may expose you to other dangers at the GM's discretion).</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make a Prescience roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated. However, you must retest your new roll against the Resolve scores of those in the targeted area to determine whether or not they can sense your presence.
    You can attempt to scry the same target any number of times, but if your action roll fails, that target becomes immune to your scrying for 24 hours.

    Silence overcomes the target, whether from the warping of sound around the target, or from a physical effect like strangulation or suffocation.
  effect: |
    If Might, Agility, or Entropy is used to inflict this bane, then the character is suffering strangulation and unable to speak. If the bane is inflicted using Alteration, then all sound within 5' of the target is suppressed through extraordinary means, making their footsteps and the usual clank of belongings they are carrying inaudible.

    The target's movement is impaired, either by extreme cold, prolonged heat, poison, or injury to one or both legs.

    The afflicted target's speed is reduced to half its current speed, rounded down to the nearest 5' increment. This applies to all movement that is physical (flight, walking, climbing, etc.). If the target is currently under a magical effect that increases speed, the two effects are canceled for the duration that both affect the target.

    Stunning an enemy can be caused by anything from the pommel of a dagger to the back of the head, to a kick in the groin, to a deafening thunderclap that disorients the target.
  effect: |
    During the target's turn, they are limited to either a single major action, a single move action, or a single minor action. Effects that grant additional actions do not circumvent this unless they grant a free action. Note that a target expending its move action to resist this bane will receive the remainder of their usual actions if the resist roll succeeds.
  special: |
    This bane has special rules for boss NPCs (See Chapter 8: Running the Game). A boss is only affected by the stunned bane during its normal initative turn. It may still take all of its boss actions as usual.

  duration: Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
  description: |
    The stupefied bane has examples in many stories and legends: a vampire's eyes, a siren's song, and a nymph's beauty are all known to cast a stupor upon weak-willed mortals. Being stupefied causes the character to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and pacifism.
  effect: |
    The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the target's Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the target has the approximate intelligence of a child. If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively attempting to break free. However, the target's true mind is suppressed but fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional resist roll to break free from the bane. Also any action that would startle a wild animal (being hit with a rock, slapped on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target's typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Via control of the target's mind, you compel them to honesty, rendering them unable to deliberately lie.
  effect: |
    The target answers any question asked with honesty, to the best of their knowledge. When compelled to reveal something they would not reveal outside of duress, the target makes a Will roll and you make an Influence roll. If the target's roll is higher than yours, then they resist the bane and the effect ends.
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of its duration, you can make another Influence roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated.
    When a target wins the contested Will vs. Influence roll, you cannot target them with this bane again for 24 hours.
